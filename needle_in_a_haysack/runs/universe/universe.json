      "title": "Ultrasonographic Evaluation of Gastric Content and Volume in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: A Prospective Observational Study.",
      "abstract": "Anesthesia-related complications, such as pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, occur in approximately 0.02-0.1% of elective pediatric surgeries. Aspiration risk can be reliably assessed by ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum, making it an essential non-invasive bedside tool. In this prospective observational study, since most of our patients are immigrants and have communication problems, we wanted to investigate gastric contents and the occurrence of \"high risk stomach\" in children undergoing elective surgery for the possibility of pulmonary aspiration, even if the children and/or parents reported their last oral intake time. This risk is defined by ultrasound findings of solid content in the antrum and/or a calculated gastric volume exceeding 1.25 mL/kg. Children aged 2-18 were included in the study. Both supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) ultrasound examinations were performed on the antrum before surgery. Using a qualitative grading scale from 0 to 2, we evaluated the gastric fluid content. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the antrum was measured in the RLD position, aiding the calculation of the gastric fluid volume according to an established formula by Perlas. Ultrasound measurements of 97 children were evaluated. The median fasting duration was 4 h for liquids and 9 h for thick liquids and solids. Solid content was absent in all the children. Five children (5.2%) exhibited a grade 2 antrum, implying that fluid content was visible in both the supine and RLD positions. The median antral CSA in the RLD was 2.36 cm",

      "abstract": "Intragastric balloons (IGBs) are an increasingly popular management strategy for obesity. The Allurion IGB is a swallowable balloon that spontaneously degrades after residing in the stomach for 4 months. We describe a technique for safe retrieval of an Allurion IGB using endoscopic accessories available at hospitals without a dedicated bariatric service. Nausea and pain are often encountered following IGB insertion. Infrequent but serious adverse events have been noted by NICE. As it does not normally require endoscopic removal, a specific endoscopic kit has not been designed for the Allurion IGB. Devices designed for other types of IGBs have previously been used to extract the Allurion balloon. We achieved a similar outcome using an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) aspiration needle. Although general anaesthetic for IGB removal remains contentious, we felt this represented the safest strategy given the risk of aspiration as well as the lack of prior experience at our centre.",

      "title": "Point of care gastric ultrasound to predict aspiration in patients undergoing urgent endotracheal intubation in the emergency medicine department.",
      "abstract": "One significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation is the aspiration of gastric contents. Its prevalence is more in the emergency than in elective settings. Point-of-care gastric ultrasound (GUS) is a non-invasive bedside ultrasonogram that provides both qualitative and quantitative information about the stomach contents. The diagnostic accuracy of GUS in terms of gastric parameters (measured antral diameters, antral cross-sectional area, and calculated gastric volume) to predict aspiration is yet unknown. We aim to determine this in the patients undergoing urgent emergency intubation (UEI) in the emergency department. A prospective observational study was conducted at the emergency department of a tertiary healthcare center in India. Patients requiring UEI were identified and a bedside gastric ultrasound was done in the right lateral decubitus position using low frequency curved array probe. The qualitative data and the antral diameters (anteroposterior and craniocaudal) were assessed. The patient's clinical parameters and history regarding the last meal were noted. The cross-sectional area of gastric antrum was calculated using CSA = (AP × CC) π/4. The gastric volume is estimated using Perla's formula: GV = 27.0 + 14.6(RLD CSA) -1.28(age). A hundred patients requiring urgent endotracheal intubation were enrolled in the study. Visible aspiration was more in participants with a distended gastric status (χ2 = 16.880, p =  < 0.001). The median gastric volume in the patients who aspirated was 146.37 mL, and it ranged from 111.59 mL-201.01 mL. Using ROC analysis, a cut-off of CC diameter ≥ 2.35 cm (sensitivity 88%, specificity 91%) and AP diameter ≥ 5.15 cm (sensitivity 88%, specificity 87%) predicts aspiration. A calculated USG CSA cut-off ≥ 9.27cm Point-of-care gastric ultrasound is an useful non-invasive bedside tool for risk stratification for aspiration in busy emergency rooms. We present threshold gastric antral parameters that can be used to predict aspiration along with its diagnostic accuracy. This can help the treating ED physician take adequate precautions, decide on intubation techniques and treatment modifications to aid in better patient management.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the gastric fluid volume (GFV) in children who fasted 1 versus 2 hours using ultrasound, after ingestion of a defined volume of clear fluid. Children scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. After receiving 3 mL kg -1 clear fluid, participants were randomized to have a gastric ultrasound after fasting for either 1 hour (1-hour group, n = 116) or 2 hours (2-hour group, n = 111). Our primary outcome was the GFV. Other outcomes included the antral cross-sectional area, frequency of high risk and low risk of aspiration, and qualitative grading for the gastric antrum. Two hundred and twenty-seven children were available for final analysis. The median (Q1-Q3) GFV was higher in the 1-hour group versus the 2-hour group (0.61 [0.41-0.9] mL kg -1 vs 0.32 [0.23-0.47] mL kg -1 ; P value = .001). None of the study groups had GFV ≥1.5 mL kg -1 . The frequency (%) of GFV ≥1.25 mL kg -1 was comparable between both groups (2 [1.7%] vs 0 [0%], P value = .165). However, the frequency of GFV ≥0.8 mL kg -1 was higher in 1-hour group than in 2-hour group (34.5% vs 4.5%), and grade 2 antral grading score was 56.9% in 1-hour group vs 0.9% in 2-hour group ( P value <.001). In healthy children scheduled for elective surgery receiving 3 mL kg -1 clear fluid, the median GFV after 1-hour fasting was double the volume after conventional 2-hour fasting. These findings should be considered whether weighting the risk/benefit of a liberal approach to preoperative fasting versus the risk of pulmonary aspiration.",

In addition to a 28 mm pancreatic head tumor, soft tissue shadow and fluid collection surrounding the superior mesenteric artery(SMA)due to pancreatitis were observed in the abdominal CT scan. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1 was performed to control the progression of the pancreatic cancer and improve the inflammatory changes for reduction of the operative risk. After 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, abdominal CT scan revealed stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and attenuation of the inflammatory changes surrounding the SMA. Then, subtotal stomach- preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed without the difficulty of peeling around the SMA in spite of the old inflammatory changes. Histological examination of the resected specimen showed R0 resection. The patient was discharged 18 days after surgery without any complications and is surviving 9 months postoperatively without any recurrence.

      "title": "Editorial \"Minute Zero: an essential assessment in peri-operative ultrasound for anaesthesia\".",
      "abstract": "I have attentively read the article \"Minute Zero: an essential assessment in peri-operative ultrasound for anaesthesia\" by Elena Segura-Grau et al. [1]. The authors have suggested using point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) as part of a comprehensive anaesthetic assessment in the perioperative period. Such an extension of the standard perioperative examination aimed at searching for pathologies that may affect the intra- and postoperative course performed by an anaes-thesiologist seems fully justified and may have a significant impact on treatment outcomes [2]. In the \"Minute Zero\" model, the authors have suggested that POCUS assessment of anaesthetised patients should be carried out twice - on admission to the operating theatre and before transfer to the postoperative ward. The described scheme is based on the well-known eFAST, FATE and BLUE protocols (assessment to determine the presence of free fluid in the body cavities, basic cardiac assessment, including IVC, and lung ultrasound assessment). The examination conducted in the manner specified by the authors provides a general but holistic picture of the patient, focused at detecting life-threatening pathologies. It is right to include a preoperative assessment of the filling of the stomach in the protocol, as the surface area of the pylorus found on ultrasound scans indicates the risk of aspiration during the induction of general anaesthesia [3, 4]. This may be of particular importance in patients undergoing emergency procedures, with gastrointestinal obstruction or in those with difficult contact (mainly children and the elderly). In the algorithm described, the assessment of bladder filling in the postoperative period has been emphasised. This is a huge asset, which is often overlooked and, as the authors rightly point out, can cause postoperative delirium, especially in the elderly. The authors have developed an examination card that enables to document the examination in a simple and transparent manner based on markings of the appropriate blanks, which makes the protocol very friendly. The additional pros of the publication are the attached sample ultrasound images, which perfectly illustrate the ease of diagnosis of basic pathologies.",

      "abstract": "In hepatology, the clinical use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has experienced a notable increase in recent times. These applications range from the diagnosis to the treatment of various liver diseases. Therefore, this systematic review summarizes the evidence for the diagnostic and therapeutic roles of EUS in liver diseases. To examine and summarize the current available evidence of the possible roles of the EUS in making a suitable diagnosis in liver diseases as well as the therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were extensively searched until October 2023. The methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale or Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. In addition, statistical analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Overall, 45 articles on EUS were included (28 on diagnostic role and 17 on therapeutic role). Pooled analysis demonstrated that EUS diagnostic tests had an accuracy of 92.4% for focal liver lesions (FLL) and 96.6% for parenchymal liver diseases. EUS-guided liver biopsies with either fine needle aspiration or fine needle biopsy had low complication rates when sampling FLL and parenchymal liver diseases (3.1% and 8.7%, respectively). Analysis of data from four studies showed that EUS-guided liver abscess had high clinical (90.7%) and technical success (90.7%) without significant complications. Similarly, EUS-guided interventions for the treatment of gastric varices (GV) have high technical success (98%) and GV obliteration rate (84%) with few complications (15%) and rebleeding events (17%). EUS in liver diseases is a promising technique with the potential to be considered a first-line therapeutic and diagnostic option in selected cases.",

      "abstract": "An atypical cytologic diagnosis arises from inflammation or early neoplastic process. It is commonly found in EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration/biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB) tissue sampling of pancreatic malignancies. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of EUS-FNA/FNB in patients with cytologic diagnosis of atypical cells and to develop a prediction model for malignant tumors of the pancreas in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category. Two hundred and twenty-six patients in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictive factors for pancreatic malignancies. The final diagnoses were confirmed by repeat biopsy; surgical pathology, or clinical follow-up for at least 6 months. The atypical cytologic diagnosis using EUS-FNA/FNB was associated with an absolute risk of malignancy (82.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that older age, long axis of the mass, and increased carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were independent risk factors for true malignant pancreatic tumors among patients in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category. The calibration curve had a slope of 0.96, and a regression coefficient (R Atypical lesions of EUS-FNA/FNB have a higher risk of malignancy. Older age, the long axis of the mass, and elevated serum CA19-9 level were identified as independent risk factors for true malignant pancreatic tumors among patients in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying and may increase aspiration risk. Recent guidelines suggest using prokinetic agents pre-operatively, but no studies have assessed the efficacy of erythromycin for this purpose. We present a 53-year-old man (weight 110 kg) taking liraglutide and undergoing elective knee arthroscopy. Despite 19 h of fasting and withholding liraglutide, gastric ultrasound revealed a grade 3 antrum with solid content. Intravenous erythromycin 300 mg was administered, causing transient gastrointestinal symptoms. A repeat ultrasound 15 min later showed reduced solid content, although the antrum was not convincingly empty. As the patient declined neuraxial anaesthesia without sedation, a modified rapid sequence induction was performed. An ultrasound scan at the completion of surgery confirmed an empty stomach, and recovery was uneventful. This is the first documented case using gastric ultrasound to assess the effect of erythromycin on a patient taking a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. While erythromycin achieved its desired effect within 100 min, the optimal timing for prokinetic administration and subsequent ultrasound assessment remains uncertain. Gastric ultrasound may refine risk stratification and guide prokinetic use for these patients. Further research is needed to determine optimal erythromycin dosing, time to desired effect and side effects to optimise peri-operative management.",

This review highlights physiologic changes of pregnancy and presents clinical recommendations based on recent literature to guide anesthetic management for the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery. Nearly every anesthetic technique has been safely used in pregnant patients. Although it is difficult to eliminate confounding factors, exposure to anesthetics could endanger fetal brain development. Perioperative fetal monitoring decisions require an obstetric consult based on anticipated maternal and fetal concerns. Given the limitations of fasting guidelines, bedside gastric ultrasound is useful in assessing aspiration risk in pregnant patients. Although there is concern about appropriateness of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal due its binding to progesterone, preliminary literature supports its safety. These recommendations will equip anesthesiologists to provide safe care for the pregnant patient and fetus undergoing nonobstetric surgery.",

Very early risk stratification of GIB patients can sometimes be a challenge. The decision to intubate these patients is multifactorial and requires careful consideration. Gastric ultrasound (GUS) is an adjunct tool that may help make such decisions and is supported by anesthesiology society guidelines to assess aspiration risk. In this manuscript, we present a case series of ED patients with upper GIB in whom emergency physicians (2 fellowship-trained attendings and 2 senior residents facile with point-of-care ultrasound) performed GUS. As a supplement to the clinical examination, this sonographic \"lavage\" (i.e., using GUS in patients with upper GIB) helped predict aspiration risk, support diagnostic reasoning, and expedite early goal-directed management and appropriate disposition. We also provide a step-by-step tutorial using high-quality media, as well as a novel algorithm for translation of this technique to the bedside for emergency physicians.",

      "abstract": "Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are highly susceptible to malnutrition, and while enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube is the preferred method, there is a risk of inadvertent reflux and aspiration. Therefore, clinicians have turned to nasointestinal tubes (NET) for enteral nutrition as an alternative option. But the precise localization of NET presents an ongoing challenge. We proposed an innovative approach to provide a valuable reference for clinicians involved in NET placement. Data were obtained retrospectively from the medical records of adult patients with a high risk of aspiration or gastric feeding intolerance who had a NET placed in the ICU of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital between October 1, 2017, and October 1, 2023. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS and R software. There were 494 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The first-pass success rate was 81.4% (n = 402). The success of a patient's initial NET placement was found to be associated with Angle SPC and Distance CP, as determined by univariate analysis (25.6 ± 16.7° vs. 41.9 ± 18.0°, P < 0.001; 40.0 ± 26.2 mm vs. 62.0 ± 31.8 mm, P < 0.001, respectively). By conducting a multivariate regression analysis, we identified a significant association between pyloric types and the success rate of placing NET (OR 29.559, 95%CI 14.084-62.038, P < 0.001). Angle SPC, Distance CP, and the type of pylorus are independently associated with successful initial placement of NET. Besides, patients with the outside type of pylorus (OP-type) exhibit a higher rate of initial placement success.",

      "abstract": "Preoperative fasting is a common practice to decrease perioperative aspiration risk. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommends preoperative fasting of 8 hours after a full meal. ASA preoperative fasting recommendation is based on the Western diet. A typical Western diet has a higher fat content than Asian standard solid meals. This study aimed to analyze intragastric volume with ultrasound after 6-hour and 8-hour fasting after an Asian traditional solid meal. This cohort study recruited 37 subjects from January to February 2019. Subjects were patients scheduled for elective non-digestive surgery and planned for preoperative fasting of 8 hours. Before preoperative fasting, all subjects consumed standard Asian meals. We performed an ultrasound of the gastric antrum during the relaxation phase after two contractions. After a good image was acquired, the cross-sectional area and gastric volume (GV) were calculated. GV was grouped based on a border value of 1.5 mL/kg. GV 6 hours after solid intake was 30.93 (1.60-205.25) mL, and GV 8 hours after solid intake was 16.34 (0.73-62.49) mL (P = 0.002). After 6 hours, 5.4% of the subjects had a GV above 1.5 mL/ kg, while after fasting for 8 hours, the GV of all subjects was below 1.5 mL/kg. Age was correlated moderately and negatively with the GV of 6 hours and 8 hours fasting (P < 0.001, correlation coefficient = -0.610, and P < 0.001, correlation coefficient = -0.580).

This study aimed to assess the effect of preoperative oral domperidone on gastric residual volume, detected by ultrasound for patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. This randomized double-blinded controlled placebo trial was conducted in 40 patients who were randomly assigned to two equal groups: the domperidone group (D) ( n = 20): patients received 400 mL of apple juice as a clear fluid, two hours preoperatively, and an oral domperidone 10 mg tablet; and the placebo group (P) ( n = 20): patients received 400 mL of apple juice as a clear fluid two hours preoperatively with a placebo tablet. Gastric residual volume detected by ultrasound was the primary outcome and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was the secondary outcome. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean gastric residual volume detected by ultrasound between groups after 1 hour ( P > 0.05). However, the mean gastric residual volume detected by ultrasound after 2 hours was statistically significantly lower with domperidone (55.95 ± 6.72 mL) than with the placebo group (70.22 ± 13.00 mL) ( P < 0.05).

      "title": "The role of gastric ultrasound in anaesthesia for emergency surgery: A review and clinical guidance.",
      "abstract": "The timing and technique of anaesthesia are challenging in patients with a history of recent food intake. The presence of gastric contents increases the risk of aspiration, potentially resulting in acute lung injury, pneumonia, or death. Delayed gastric emptying complicates the estimation of aspiration risk. Surprisingly, there are no fasting guidelines for emergency surgery. Point-of-care gastric ultrasound is a time-efficient, cost-efficient and accurate bedside tool with which to estimate residual gastric content and to guide decision-making in airway management and timing of general anaesthesia. This review summarises the prevailing concepts of ultrasound-guided gastric content assessment for emergency surgery. Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies using ultrasound for the evaluation of gastric content in adults scheduled for emergency surgery. Five prospective observational studies representing 793 emergency surgery patients showed that the incidence of 'full stomach' was between 18 and 56% at the time of induction. Risk factors for a full stomach before emergency surgery were abdominal or gynaecological/obstetric surgery, high body mass index and morphine consumption. No correlation between preoperative fasting time and the presence of a full/empty stomach was found. No deaths due to aspiration were reported. The preoperative presence of gastric content before emergency surgery is high and the estimates used for clinical management are unreliable. This review demonstrates that gastric ultrasound is a valuable tool for evaluating gastric content. A flow chart for medical decision-making using gastric ultrasound before emergency surgery was developed to assist in clinical decision-making. The validity and practical applicability should be assessed in future studies.",

Assessment of gastric content by ultrasound is a good method to quantify gastric volume and to determine the risk of intraoperative pulmonary aspiration. The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of the gastric ultrasonography in the qualitative analysis of gastric content, mainly in the analysis of small amounts of liquid content. Gastric ultrasound was performed to 36 patients before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI), making two longitudinal scans at the epigastric level, one in supine position and the other in right lateral decubitus position, measuring two diameters and the area of the gastric antrum and assessing the content characteristics determining whether it was an empty stomach or contained fluid or solid content. Subsequently, the ultrasound findings were compared with UGI findings. Gastric areas were analyzed by the trace and the lengths of the craniocaudal and anteroposterior axes concluding that there are no significant differences between the two methods. No statistically significant difference was found between UGI and US assessment technics. No statistically significant difference was found between the estimated volume by UGI and US. Though our study has some limitations, qualitative analysis of gastric content using ultrasound followed by endoscopy enabled the conclusion that there are no differences in the qualitative assessment regarding these two techniques, supporting the important role of point-of-care gastric ultrasound (POCGUS) in the assessment of pulmonary aspiration risk by the anesthesiologist in the perioperative period.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration of solid components leads to displacement of the tracheobronchial tree, the aspiration of acidic gastric juices to chemical pneumonitis (Mendelson's syndrome) and the aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions or gastrointestinal pathogens to aspiration pneumonia. Principally, pulmonary aspiration can occur at any stage of anesthesia. In the clinical routine the aim must therefore be to identify those patients who have an increased risk of aspiration. When this is successful, measures can be taken to reduce the risk; these can be regional anaesthesia or the performance of general anaesthesia as rapid sequence induction (RSI). If severe pulmonary aspiration occurs despite all preventive measures, mostly during induction of anaesthesia, extensive experience and rapid action are necessary. This can only be achieved if the induction to RSI is performed by three persons with supervision of the trainee anaesthetist by a consultant anaesthetist. Die pulmonale Aspiration von festen Bestandteilen führt zur Verlegung des Tracheobronchialbaums, die Aspiration von saurem Magensaft zur chemischen Pneumonitis (Mendelson-Syndrom) und die Aspiration von oropharyngealen Sekreten oder Magen-Darm-Keimen zur Aspirationspneumonie. Grundsätzlich kann eine pulmonale Aspiration zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Anästhesie auftreten. Im klinischen Alltag muss es daher das Ziel sein, diejenigen Patienten zu identifizieren, die ein erhöhtes Risiko für eine Aspiration haben. Wenn dies gelingt, können Maßnahmen ergriffen werden, um das Risiko zu reduzieren; dies können Regionalanästhesien sein oder die Durchführung der Allgemeinanästhesie als Rapid sequence induction (RSI). Kommt es trotz aller Vorsichtsmaßnahmen zu einer schwergradigen Aspiration – meist bei der Narkoseeinleitung – sind viel Erfahrung und schnelles Handeln erforderlich; dies ist nur zu erreichen, wenn die Einleitung zur RSI zu dritt erfolgt und ein Facharzt den Weiterbildungsassistenten überwacht.",

However, the role of qualitative and quantitative gastric ultrasound assessments in this patient population before anesthesia induction has not yet been determined. Adult patients with gastrointestinal cancer were recruited and examined using gastric point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) before anesthetic induction from March 2023 to August 2023 in a tertiary cancer center. Three hundred patients with gastric cancer were conducted with POCUS prior to induction, and three hundred patients with colorectal cancer were included as controls. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the gastric antrum and gastric volumes (GV) were measured and calculated. We determined the nature of the gastric contents and classified the antrum using a 3-point grading system. A ratio of GV to body weight > 1.5mL/Kg was defined as a high risk of aspiration. In patients with gastric cancer, 70 patients were classified as grade 2 (23%, including 6 patients with solid gastric contents) and 63 patients (21%) were identified as having a high risk of aspiration. Whereas in patients with colorectal cancer, only 11 patients were classified as grade 2 (3.7%), and 27 patients (9.7%) were identified as having a high risk of aspiration.

We performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 6 months. One year after surgery, contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 15 mm mass in the posterior wall of the gastric body. EUS showed a hypoechoic mass in the muscular layer in the gastric wall, which was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by FNA. We diagnosed gastric wall recurrence due to needle tract seeding(NTS)following EUS-FNA and performed partial gastrectomy. Histopathological diagnosis was gastric wall recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Since NTS following EUS-FNA can be proven only by the presence of gastric wall recurrence after surgery for pancreatic body or tail cancer, the actual risk of NTS including peritoneal dissemination is not clear and may have been underestimated. In case of resectable pancreatic body or tail cancer, indication for EUS-FNA should be carefully considered.",

      "title": "Effects of Preoperative Oral Carbohydrate on Cirrhotic Patients under Endoscopic Therapy with Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
      "abstract": "Preoperative fasting causes significant perioperative discomfort in patients. Preoperative oral carbohydrate (POC) is an important element of the enhanced recovery after surgery protocol, but its effect on cirrhotic patients who tend to have abnormal gastric emptying remains unclarified. We investigated the influence of POC on gastric emptying and preprocedural well-being in cirrhotic patients. A prospective, randomized, controlled study of cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices scheduled for elective therapeutic endoscopy under intravenous anesthesia was conducted. We enrolled 180 patients and divided them into three groups: those not supplemented with carbohydrates for 8 h before therapeutic endoscopy (control group) and those administered a carbohydrate beverage 2 h (2 h group) and 4 h (4 h group) before endoscopy. The residual gastric volume was quantified before anesthesia, gastric emptying was evaluated using gastric ultrasonography, and preprocedural well-being was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Preanesthesia gastric sonography scores were similar among the three groups. No patient had residual gastric volume > 1.5 ml/kg in the control and 4 h groups, but six patients (11%) had a residual gastric volume of >1.5 ml/kg in the 2 h group, hence were at a risk of regurgitation and aspiration. Moreover, VAS scores for six parameters (thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue) in the 2 h group and three parameters (thirst, hunger, and mouth dryness) in the 4 h group were significantly lower than those in the control group, suggesting a beneficial effect on cirrhotic patients' well-being. Preoperative gastric peristaltic and operation scores, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital expenses were not significantly different among the three groups. Our study indicated that avoiding preoperative fasting with oral carbohydrates administered 4 h before anesthesia can be achieved in cirrhotic patients. Further studies to assess whether POC can help improve postoperative outcomes in cirrhotic patients are needed.",

Fasted patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation were included. Ultrasonographic measurements of ACSA were conducted in both semi-recumbent and right lateral decubitus positions before endoscopic procedures. Gastroscopy was employed to guide the measurement of suctioned gastric volume (GV). Ultrasonography was performed to assess gastric contents and identify patients with high-risk stomach. The relationship between ACSA and suctioned GV was also evaluated. ACSA was evaluated in 736 out of 782 patients. A significant positive correlation was discovered between ACSA in the right lateral decubitus position and suctioned GV, which was more reliable than in the semi-recumbent position. To analyze high-risk stomach with a GV > 100 mL, the cutoff value of ACSA in the right lateral decubitus was found to be 7.5 cm Ultrasonographic measurement of ACSA can assist anesthesiologists in estimating the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during general anesthesia and sedation.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration pneumonitis remains a dreaded complication that may lead to almost 9% of anaesthesia-related deaths. The presence of gastric contents has always been a contributing factor to an increased risk of aspiration. Preoperative gastric ultrasound has been suggested as a modality for determining residual volume in special populations and conditions. We conducted an observational study to determine the gastric residual volume in preoperative patients of elective surgery with gastric ultrasound and to study its correlation with patient factors. We enrolled 411 patients in the age group of 18-80 with ASA-PS I and II having BMI less than 35 kg/m On qualitative assessment, 97 and 118 patients were observed to have distended stomachs in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions, respectively. On quantitative assessment, 336 had safe GRV, 60 patients were classified as having a low risk of aspiration (GRV < 1.5 ml/kg) while 13 had a high risk of aspiration (> 1.5 ml/kg). Eight patients with a fasting duration of more than ten hours and five who fasted between 6 and 10 h had a gastric residual volume of more than 1.5 ml/h. Patients who were premedicated with histamine blockers had a statistically significant higher antral cross-sectional area (p-value - 0.022*) and GRV (p-value - 0.018*) in the right lateral decubitus position compared to patients who had taken proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). As BMI increased, there was a statistically significant (p-value < 0.001) increase in mean antral CSA in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions. There was a statistically significant association found between type 2 diabetes (p-value 0.045*) with antral grade. Patients can have significant residual volume (> 1.5 ml/kg) despite adequate fasting, and preoperative gastric ultrasound can help in assessing the same and guiding perioperative airway management. PPIs are more effective in reducing gastric residual volume as compared to histamine blockers. Patients with a BMI of more than 30 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have significant correlation with increased gastric residual volume mandating preoperative gastric ultrasound assessment for effective management. Patients with BMI over 30 and type 2 diabetes may benefit from POCGUS to guide perioperative airway management by stratifying GRV.

      "title": "A Case of Esophageal Retention Cyst with High Fluorodeoxyglucose Uptake on PET/CT Scan.",
      "abstract": "Esophageal retention cysts are rare, benign lesions that can mimic submucosal tumors. Their clinical presentation and imaging characteristics may lead to diagnostic challenges, particularly when fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) shows increased uptake, raising suspicion of malignancy. A 77-year-old man presented with epigastric pain. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an esophageal mass, prompting referral to our hospital. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) identified a hypoechoic submucosal tumor with multiple cystic components in the lower esophagus. However, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) did not yield a definitive diagnosis. CT scan demonstrated a 60-mm space-occupying lesion (SOL) in the lower thoracic esophagus with peripheral contrast enhancement and a central low-density area. MRI revealed a SOL in the lower esophagus with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and moderate signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The lesion contained cystic components exhibiting high T2 and low T1 signal intensities. FDG-PET/CT revealed intense FDG uptake, increasing from maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 11 to 18 over time. Given the large size of the tumor, symptomatology, and inability to exclude malignancy-particularly high-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumor-surgical resection was performed. Laparoscopic esophagectomy was conducted using intraoperative endoscopy for tumor identification. The esophagus was transected proximally using a linear stapler, followed by extracorporeal gastric conduit reconstruction and the overlap technique was used to perform an esophagogastric anastomosis. Postoperatively, anastomotic leakage was detected on day 3, requiring emergency reoperation. The leak had resolved by POD 26, and the patient was discharged on day 48 after the second surgery (day 51 after the initial surgery). Histopathological examination revealed multiple cysts of varying sizes within the lamina propria, lined by columnar epithelium, with no evidence of malignancy. The final diagnosis was esophageal retention cyst. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of esophageal retention cysts with high FDG uptake. While PET/CT is essential in oncologic imaging, FDG accumulation does not always indicate malignancy.",

      "abstract": "Today, preoperative fasting guidelines have changed, allowing clear liquid intake up to 1 h before surgery. However, concerns remain regarding the risk of aspiration associated with clear liquid intake. This study aimed to investigate the impact of clear fluid given 1 h before surgery on child anxiety and gastric volumes. A prospective, randomized, controlled study included 90 patients aged 5-12 years. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups by a computer-generated randomization: group F (n = 30): standard fasting group, group W (n = 30): patients who received oral water at a dose of 5 mL/kg 1 h before surgery, group C (n = 30): patients who received oral carbohydrate fluid at a dose of 5 mL/kg 1 h before surgery. All patients were assessed using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) before and 1 h after fluid administration. Antral cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured with ultrasonography after intubation, and gastric residual volume (GRV) was calculated. Hemodynamic data, blood sugar level, and parental satisfaction were also recorded. The m-YPAS scores obtained after 1 h were significantly lower in group C than in the other groups (p &lt; 0.001). Antral CSA and GRV values were lower in group C and group W than in the fasting group (p &lt; 0.001). Parental satisfaction was highest in group C. This study suggests that allowing a carbohydrate-rich clear liquid intake 1 h before surgery can significantly reduce preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients without increasing the risk of aspiration.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged fasting before surgery is commonly practiced reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia induction, but it can cause discomfort and negative recovery process. Preoperative carbohydrate intake, particularly maltodextrin solutions, has emerged as a strategy to enhance recovery while addressing these challenges. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of preoperative maltodextrin intake in 70 patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Participants were divided into 2 groups: a maltodextrin group (n = 35), who consumed a 15% maltodextrin solution (300 mL) 2 hours before surgery, and a fasting group (n = 33), who followed conventional overnight fasting. Key outcomes included gastric residual volume (GRV) and gastric pH, assessed via ultrasound and pH measurement. The mean GRV per body weight was 0.62 ± 0.4 mL/kg in the maltodextrin group and 0.54 ± 0.3 mL/kg in the fasting group (P = .4), showing no significant difference. Gastric pH was 3.45 ± 1.62 in the maltodextrin group and 3.21 ± 1.58 in the fasting group (P = .11). No cases of aspiration or reflux were observed during anesthesia. Preoperative maltodextrin consumption is a safe and effective alternative to traditional fasting, reducing discomfort without compromising patient safety. These findings support the integration of carbohydrate intake into enhanced recovery after surgery protocols to improve perioperative care and outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosing early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, particularly high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PanIN), remains challenging. Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytologic examination (SPACE) using an endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, but its application in surgically altered anatomy is technically demanding. We present a case in which balloon enteroscopy-assisted SPACE led to the diagnosis of HG-PanIN and successful resection. A 70-year-old man with a history of distal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction for gastric cancer underwent follow-up imaging, which revealed localized main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture and parenchymal atrophy in the pancreatic tail. EUS identified a faint hypoechoic area around the stricture, but no distinct mass. EUS-guided tissue acquisition was inconclusive. Double-balloon enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed, revealing MPD stricture and distal dilation. A 5F endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube was placed across the stricture, and SPACE was conducted. Twelve pancreatic juice cytology samples were aspirated every 2 to 3 hours over 3 days, each exceeding 1 mL. One sample (10th) was classified as Class IV, \"suspicious for adenocarcinoma,\" with cytology revealing nuclear enlargement and atypia. The patient was diagnosed preoperatively with pancreatic cancer (TisN0M0 stage 0) and underwent distal pancreatectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathology confirmed HG-PanIN of the MPD. The patient had no postoperative adverse events and remained recurrence-free at the 9-month follow-up. This case highlights the effectiveness of balloon enteroscopy-assisted SPACE in diagnosing HG-PanIN in surgically altered anatomy. However, given the relatively high risk of pancreatitis, SPACE should be reserved for patients with imaging or clinical findings suggestive of malignancy. By overcoming technical obstacles, this method offers a promising diagnostic strategy for early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in surgically altered anatomy.",

      "title": "Gastric Point of Care Ultrasound in Adults: Image Acquisition and Interpretation.",
      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, diagnostic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has emerged as a rapid and non-invasive bedside tool for addressing clinical inquiries related to gastric content. One emerging concern pertains to patients about to undergo sedation and/or endotracheal intubation: the elevated risk of aspiration from the patient's stomach contents. Aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs poses a serious and potentially life-threatening complication. This occurs more frequently when the stomach is considered \"full\" and can be affected by the techniques employed for airway management, making it potentially preventable. To mitigate the risk of peri-procedural aspiration, two distinct medical specialties (anesthesiology and critical care medicine) have independently developed techniques to utilize ultrasonography for identifying patients requiring \"full stomach\" precautions. Due to these separate specialties, the work of each group remains relatively unfamiliar outside its respective field. This article presents descriptions of both techniques for gastric ultrasound. Furthermore, it explains how these approaches can complement each other when one of them falls short. Regarding image acquisition, the article covers the following topics: indications and contraindications, selection of the appropriate probe, patient positioning, and troubleshooting. The article also delves into image interpretation, complete with example images. Additionally, it demonstrates how one of the two techniques can be employed to estimate gastric fluid volume. Lastly, the article briefly discusses medical decision-making based on the findings of this examination.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration pneumonitis is an inflammatory disease of the lungs which is difficult to diagnose accurately. Large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents is essential for the development of aspiration pneumonitis. The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is often underestimated as a rare etiological factor for aspiration in the diagnosis process of aspiration pneumonitis. We present a case of a patient with 4 weeks of right-sided watery rhinorrhea accompanied by intermittent postnasal drip and dry cough as the main symptoms. Combined with clinical symptoms, imaging examination of the sinuses, and laboratory examination of nasal secretions, she was initially diagnosed as spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, and intraoperative endoscopic findings and postoperative pathology also confirmed this diagnosis. Her chest computed tomography showed multiple flocculent ground glass density shadows in both lungs on admission. The patient underwent endoscopic resection of meningoencephalocele and repair of skull base defect after she was ruled out of viral pneumonitis. Symptoms of rhinorrhea and dry cough disappeared, and pneumonitis was improved 1 week after surgery and cured 2 months after surgery. Persistent CSF rhinorrhea caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele was eventually found to be a major etiology for aspiration pneumonitis although the absence of typical symptoms and well-defined risk factors for aspiration, such as dysphagia, impaired cough reflex and reflux diseases. We report a rare case of aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, which can bring more attention and understanding to the uncommon etiology for aspiration, so as to make more accurate diagnosis of the disease and early surgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Tools for the evaluation of gastric emptying have evolved over time. The purpose of this study was to show that the risk of pulmonary aspiration is not increased with carbohydrate drink, by demonstrating that the gastric antral cross-sectional area (CSA) of the NO-NPO group is either equivalent to or less than that of the NPO (nil per os) group. Sixty-four patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic benign gynecologic surgery were enrolled and randomly assigned to the NPO group (n = 32) or the NO-NPO group (n = 32). After having a regular meal until midnight before surgery, the NPO group fasted until surgery, while the NO-NPO group ingested 400 mL of a carbohydrate drink at midnight and freely up to 2 hours before anesthesia. The primary outcome was the gastric antral CSA by gastric ultrasound in right lateral decubitus position (RLDP). Noninferiority was defined as a mean difference of CSA <2.8 cm2. Secondary outcomes included CSA in supine position, gastric volume (GV), GV per weight (GV/kg), GV/kg >1.5 mL/kg, and Perlas grade. CSA in RLDP was not different between the NPO group (6.25 ± 3.79 cm2) and the NO-NPO group (6.21 ± 2.48 cm2; P = .959). The mean difference of CSA in RLDP (NO-NPO group - NPO group) was 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.56 to 1.64), which was within the noninferiority margin of 2.8 cm2. CSA was not different between the 2 groups (4.17 ± 2.34 cm2 in NPO group versus 4.28 ± 1.23 cm2 in NO-NPO group; P = .828). GV in NPO group (70 ± 56 mL) was not different from NO-NPO group (66 ± 36 mL; mean difference, 3.66; 95% CI, -20 to 27; P = .756). GV/kg in the NPO group (1.25 ± 1.00 mL/kg) was not different from the NO-NPO group (1.17 ± 0.67 mL/kg; P = .694). The incidence of GV/kg > 1.5 mL/kg was not different between NPO (31.3%) and NO-NPO group (21.9%; P = .768). The median (interquartile range) of the Perlas grade was 1 (0-1) in NPO group and 0.5 (0-1) in NO-NPO group (P = .871).

Secondarily, we determined if a 2-hour fast from clear fluids is sufficient to empty the stomach in this population. 37 subjects who had undergone a gastric sleeve in the last 10 years were randomly assigned to drink 100, 200 or 300 mL of water after fasting 8 hours from solids and 2 hours from clear fluids.

The existing equation was statistically suboptimal. A new equation was created with variables identified by LASSO regression (Volume (mL)=15.5×CSA (cm The existing equation is likely still best suited for clinical use; however, the equation proposed here has superior accuracy in patients with prior gastric sleeve.

      "abstract": "Fasting before elective anesthesia care is a standardized practice worldwide. The aim is to decrease the risk of aspiration leading to pulmonary complications such as aspiration pneumonitis during anesthesia care. There are different guidelines for elective preoperative fasting in children. However, there is insufficient literature measuring gastric emptying time after breast milk or formula milk feeding in infants. This study used gastric ultrasound to determine the gastric emptying time for breast milk and formula milk in children below 6 months of age. We also compared the calculated gastric volumes among breast-fed and formula milk-fed based on Schmitz's and Spencer's formula. This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in India between November (2017-2019). A total of 52 infants less than 6 months of age were recruited. The study population was divided into two groups (breast-fed and formula milk-fed) of 26 patients each. Ultrasound was used to measure the antral cross-sectional area of the stomach and to calculate the gastric volume using the two classical formulas (Schmitz and Spencer's). Gastric emptying was reported when the bull's eye appearance of the gastric antrum was seen or when the antral cross-sectional area was less than 3.07 cm The number of breast-fed children whose antral cross-sectional was greater than 3.07 cm In our series, the gastric emptying times in breast-fed and formula-fed infants less than 6 months old were similar. Our results support the fasting guidelines of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care 2022, that is, 3 h for breastfeeding and 4 h for formula milk feeding. In addition, this shows that the Schmitz's and Spencer's formulae used to calculate the gastric volume based on ultrasound measurement of the antral cross-sectional area are not comparable in infants less than 6 months.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative management of patients receiving a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) remains challenging for the anesthesiologist. Despite the approval of GLP-1 RAs 2 decades ago, the recent reports of aspiration and postoperative pulmonary complications drew attention to this group of medications and resulted in multiple societal guidelines that would provide recommendations for anesthesiologists and proceduralists on the appropriate perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs. However, despite these guidelines and proposed options, there was a lack of adequate evidence to support holding versus continuing the medication, as well as data related to the role of gastric ultrasound in that decision-making process. The release of multiple societal guidelines and studies evaluating the impact of GLP-1 RAs on perioperative outcomes resulted in more controversy and uncertainty for the clinician anesthesiologist to follow. The ultimate goal for perioperative management of these medications is to evaluate an individual patient's risk of aspiration, rather than assuming the risk is low when holding the medication appropriately or high if not holding it. Furthermore, it is unclear whether holding these types of medicines or unnecessary postponing of surgery may result in adverse outcomes. In this narrative review, we present a summary of the existing literature on the topic with a focus on the risk of aspiration and a recommendation for perioperative management to include the utilization of gastric ultrasound for surgery patients based on their risks.",

      "abstract": "Rational preoperative fasting can reduce the risk of regurgitation and aspiration, enhance anesthesia safety and efficiency, and mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged fasting. This study investigates the existing practices of preoperative fasting management in Chinese pediatric patients and explores the real duration of preoperative fasting. This is a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire on fasting management in children was developed and an online survey was conducted among anesthesiologists. The survey mainly included the real implementation of pediatric fasting protocols, anesthesiologists' understanding of pediatric fasting management, and the application of gastric ultrasound. Moreover, data on pediatric preoperative fasting durations were collected from different hospitals across China. A total of 770 questionnaires and 1285 records of preoperative fasting cases were obtained. The survey indicated variations in preoperative fasting protocols among hospitals. Most hospitals recommended fasting for clear fluids for 2 h, while the new 1-h regimen and the liberal regimen were less implemented due to concerns regarding regurgitation and aspiration risks. Fasting for breast milk, formula milk, and solid food was mainly based on traditional protocols, with fasting durations of 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h, respectively. Most anesthesiologists have experienced regurgitation and aspiration, but there were significant differences in their awareness of the prevention and prognosis of regurgitation and aspiration. Utilization of gastric ultrasound was limited, with a lack of equipment and familiarity among anesthesiologists. Real preoperative fasting durations for children were significantly longer than those recommended in the guidelines. Factors contributing to prolonged fasting were identified. There is a big gap between preoperative fasting practices and the guidelines, and the real fasting durations of children before surgery are significantly longer than the guideline recommendations. Anesthesiologists should strengthen their understanding of preoperative fasting management in pediatric patients, master the skills of gastric ultrasound assessment, and timely address inefficiencies in pediatric preoperative fasting management.",

      "abstract": "An 83-year-old male underwent three transgastric punctures with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for the examination of a pancreatic body tumor. After a diagnosis of resectable pancreatic cancer and undergoing distal pancreatectomy, the patient was administered postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral S-1 for 6 months, and carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels were bimonthly evaluated. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels continually increased to 4638.1 U/mL at 45 months post-fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided showed a 25 mm low-echoic, irregularly shaped, and heterogeneous tumor with clear margins protruding from the mucosa outside the gastric wall, and biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Since the immunostaining findings of the specimen matched those of the previously resected specimen, needle tract seeding (NTS) due to puncture of the pancreatic cancer was identified as the cause. After a pylorus-preserving gastrectomy at 46 months post-fine-needle aspiration, postoperative chemotherapy initiation, comprising gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, was initiated; however, the patient died despite these interventions as he developed multiple peritoneal dissemination. Although rare, the incidence of NTS will increase in the future owing to the expected extended survival in post-pancreatic cancer resection cases. We suggest regular upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided evaluations for patients who are at risk for NTS can facilitate early detection. Furthermore, it is extremely relevant to share experiences of encountered NTS cases in practice and extend knowledge of its varying endoscopic appearances.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity. The physiological actions of endogenous GLP-1, and synthetic GLP-1RAs include inhibition of gastric emptying. This has peri-procedural implications due to the potential increased risk of retained gastric contents which may result in pulmonary aspiration. There is a need for local evidence-based guidelines to best manage patients on GLP-1RAs and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonists (GLP-1/GIPRAs) presenting for surgical and medical procedures requiring sedation or anaesthesia. A panel of experts was formed to consider the peri-procedural implications of GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRA use and establish best practice recommendations based on the current evidence.We recommend that all patients should be asked about glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist (GLP-1/GIPRA) use prior to anaesthesia or sedation for surgical and endoscopic procedures and be informed of the benefits and risks. We also recommend that GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs be continued in the peri-procedural period. Preprocedural diet modification with a 24-h clear fluid diet, followed by standard 6-h fasting, should be recommended for all patients receiving GLP-1RAs or GLP-1/GIPRAs. In patients who have not completed or are unable to have a 24-h liquid diet, risk stratification using gastric ultrasound or minimally sedated gastroscopy to assess gastric contents is recommended, as is the use of intravenous erythromycin. We cannot currently recommend using the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms for risk stratification, nor can we recommend an adequate cessation period for GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs to ensure gastric emptying has returned to baseline levels. This clinical guideline, developed by multiple professional bodies, outlines current best practice recommendations for patients taking GLP-1RAs and combined GLP-1/GIPRAs who require general anaesthesia, sedation and/or endoscopic procedures. The guide provides a structure for Australian and New Zealand primary health practitioners, gastroenterologists, surgeons, endocrinologists, anaesthetists and perioperative physicians to support clinical decisions in these patients.",

All included studies measured the gastric antral cross-sectional area and/or gastric residual volume in patients with diabetes and those without diabetes. The data utilized in the meta-analysis included all studies that evaluated the incidence of high-risk stomachs based on ultrasonographic measurements of the gastric antral cross-sectional area or gastric residual volume. Most collated studies revealed that diabetes mellitus was associated with increased antral cross-sectional area and gastric residual volume. A meta-analysis of published reports indicated that patients with diabetes have an increased rate of high-risk stomachs. Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased rate of high-risk stomachs.

      "title": "Unexpected reaction of \"wild-type\" gastrointestinal stromal tumor to imatinib: case report and literature review.",
      "abstract": "Most of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are driven by mutations in the KIT/PDGFRA genes and can benefit from TKIs treatment. However, a small subset of GIST (10%-15%) are called \"wild-type\" GISTs due to the lack of these mutations. Theoretically, they would not benefit from TKIs treatment and may even develop resistance. Therefore, this unexpected response may challenge inherent perceptions. Herein, we present a case of giant wild-type GIST exhibiting an unexpected response to imatinib(IM), followed by laparoscopic surgical resection. Subsequently, potential underlying mechanisms are discussed. This case describes a 57-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain for two weeks. CT revealed a massive lesion near the splenic hilum along the greater curvature of the stomach, concurrently involving the splenic hilar vessels and surrounding lymph nodes. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy confirmed it is a mesenchymal spindle cell tumor,GIST. Due to the enormous volume and local invasion, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was initially considered. After 6 months of IM 400 mg/d, CT imaging revealed marked changes in tumor heterogeneity and a significant reduction in volume. Subsequently, laparoscopic surgical resection was performed. Postoperative pathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and genetic testing collectively confirmed it is a wild-type GIST.The patient recovered well and was discharged on the 6th day after surgery, with continued oral IM(400 mg/d) after discharge. No recurrence was observed during follow-up until the publication of this report. This unexpected response suggests that wild-type GISTs may benefit from TKIs treatment, and the potential mechanisms warrant further investigation. Additionally, true wild-type GIST may not be discerned due to current limitations of Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS). Therefore, for advanced/high-risk GIST, additional genetic analysis can be performed after negative NGS results.",

      "abstract": "Preoperative gastric ultrasound allows non-invasive qualitative and quantitative assessment of gastric contents aiding in preoperative risk assessment. We hypothesized that appropriately fasted diabetic surgical patients taking GLP-1 agonists would have higher gastric volumes than those not taking GLP-1 agonists. This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled diabetic patients undergoing elective surgery, comparing those taking (n = 106) and not taking (n = 100) GLP-1 agonists. The primary outcome was gastric volume assessed via gastric ultrasound in the right lateral decubitus position. Secondary outcomes included presence of a full stomach (solids/thick liquids or greater than 1.5 mL/kg clear liquid), need for surgery delay, Perlas grade, and occurrence of intraoperative aspiration. The impact of GLP-1 agonist type, duration of use, and timing of last dose on gastric volume was also examined. Diabetic patients on GLP-1 agonists had significantly higher median gastric volumes compared to patients not on GLP-1 agonists (0.61 mL/kg vs 0.16 mL/kg, P < 0.001) and increased odds of a full stomach (OR 11.3, 95 % CI 5.2-24.7, P < 0.0001). GLP-1 agonist use correlated with higher Perlas grades (P < 0.001). Gastric volumes were significantly higher with GLP-1 agonist use within 7 days of surgery relative to use within 7-14 days or more than 14 days from surgery (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). GLP-1 agonist therapy was associated with higher residual gastric volumes and higher risks of full stomachs in fasted diabetic patients. GLP-1 agonist use within 7 days of surgery was also associated with higher gastric volumes relative to holding therapy for over 7 days, supporting current consensus-based guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Gastric emptying may be delayed in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the incidence of full stomach in fasting patients with DM and their risk of pulmonary aspiration under anaesthesia is not well understood. A scoping review was undertaken to map the literature on aspiration risk in DM. A search was conducted in seven bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, for original articles that studied aspiration risk, gastric emptying, or gastric content and volume. Selection and characterisation were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined protocol registered externally. The search identified 5063 unique records, and 16 studies (totalling 775 patients with DM) were selected: nine studied gastric emptying and seven studied gastric content or volume. There were no studies reporting the incidence of aspiration in subjects with DM. All nine studies reported delayed emptying in patients with DM compared with healthy controls. Amongst the seven studies that compared gastric residual content/volume (GRV) in the perioperative period, five reported clinically negligible GRV in both patients with DM and controls, whereas two observed a higher incidence of 'full' stomach in patients with DM. The evidence concerning the aspiration risk for surgical patients with DM is based on a limited number of studies, mostly unblinded, reporting physiological data on gastric emptying and gastric volume as surrogate markers of aspiration risk. Data on fasting gastric content and volume in patients with DM are limited and contradictory; hence, the true risk of aspiration in fasting patients with DM is unknown.",

Studies regarding factors associated with the EUS-GE outcomes are limited. A retrospective observational study was conducted with consecutive patients who underwent EUS-GE for MGOO from January 2016 to November 2023. Primary outcomes were technical success (establishing EUS-GE) and clinical success (low-residue diet tolerance without re-intervention at 90-day follow-up). Secondary outcomes were adverse events (AEs), reinterventions, and full regular diet tolerance. Technical success and clinical success rates were 92.70% (127 of 137) and 88.00%, respectively, with 42.86% of the patients tolerating a regular diet. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis had lower odds of technical success (odds ratio [OR], .19; 95% confidence interval [CI], .04-.93). Obstruction at the level of stomach, compared with duodenum, had lower odds of clinical success (OR, .06; 95% CI, .006-.56). AE and reintervention rates were 14.17% and 8.66%. Nasogastric tube decompression before EUS-GE was associated with lower AE rates in multivariable analysis (OR, .32; 95% CI, .11-.95). Prior GI surgery was associated with reintervention in multivariable analysis (OR, 4.09; 95% CI, 1.02-16.45; P = .047). EUS-GE has high technical and clinical success rates, with many patients tolerating a regular diet. Routine nasogastric tube decompression should be considered to minimize AEs. MGOO at the level of the stomach is associated with lower clinical success rates. Extra care should be taken while performing EUS-GE in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Proper treatment of GISTs requires accurate pathological diagnosis. In general, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and deep biopsy are used for pathological diagnosis of GIST before making decisions about surgery. This study sought to evaluate the pathological uniformity of gastric GISTs for mitotic index of the center and periphery of the GIST. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 37 gastric GIST patients who underwent wedge resection at Hanyang University Hospital. We used Armed Forces Institute of Pathology criteria to classify gastric GISTs. To determine the pathological uniformity of gastric GISTs, we compared GIST risk stratification between the center and periphery of GISTs. The mean size of GISTs was 3.56 ± 2.10 cm. Three lesions were located in the antrum, 11 in the fundus, 9 in the cardia, and 14 in the body. The mean age of patients was 58.65 ± 9.44 years; 18 patients were male and 19 were female. Thirty-five patients (94.6%) showed the same level of risk stratification between the center and periphery of gastric GISTs, while two patients (5.4%) presented different levels of risk between the two sites. No significant difference in mitotic count was observed between the two sites (kappa value = 0.863;  Mitotic index category (either more than five mitoses per high-power field or five or fewer mitoses per high-power field) of GISTs showed good concurrence between the center and periphery.",

      "abstract": "Owing to concerns about delayed gastric emptying or hyperglycemia, evidence is lacking regarding whether pre-operative carbohydrate loading can be routinely administered to patients with type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine the aspiration risk and gastric volume after pre-operative carbohydrate loading in patients with type 2 diabetes. A prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. The study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul, Korea, from May 2020 to May 2021. Patients (n = 49) with type 2 diabetes underwent elective noncardiac surgery. All patients were administered carbohydrate loading two hours before surgery. Once in the operating room, they underwent gastric ultrasonography to determine gastric volume. The anesthesiologists monitored the patients' glucose concentrations during and after surgery. The primary outcome was the predicted risk of aspiration. The secondary outcomes were gastric volume, antral grade, satisfaction score, and perioperative glucose profile. Forty-nine patients were analyzed. All patients had a low risk of aspiration after carbohydrate loading, as follows: 33 (67.3%) patients classified as antral grade 0 and 16 (32.7%) patients classified as antral grade 1. The median time from carbohydrate drink ingestion to ultrasound examination was 120 min (IQR 115-139). After carbohydrate loading, the median gastric volume in the right-lateral position after carbohydrate loading was 2.64 ml (IQR 0.00-32.05). The mean glucose concentrations (SD) were 134 (24) mg/dl, 159 (37) mg/dl, 150 (32) mg/dl, and 165 (36) mg/dl at baseline, after induction, 30 min after surgery, and in the post anesthesia care unit, respectively. The median satisfaction score of the patients was 5 (IQR 4-5). Pre-operative carbohydrate loading may be feasible for patients with type 2 diabetes and without complications.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04456166). Registered on 2 July 2020.",

      "abstract": "In the intensive care unit (ICU), a fasting period is usually respected to avoid gastric aspiration during airway management procedures. Since there are no recognised guidelines, intensive care physicians balance the aspiration risk with the negative consequences of underfeeding. Our objective was to determine the impact of fasting on gastric emptying in critically ill patients by using gastric ultrasound. Among the 112 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 100 patients were analysed. Gastric ultrasonography was performed immediately before extubation. Patients with either 1/ an absence of visualised gastric content (qualitative evaluation) or 2/ a gastric volume < 1.5 mll/kg in case of clear fluid gastric content (quantitative evaluation) were classified as having an empty stomach. In our study, twenty-six (26%) patients had a full stomach at the time of extubation. The incidence of full stomach was not significantly different between patients who fasted < 6 h or patients who fasted ≥ 6 h. Among the 57 patients receiving enteral nutrition (EN) within the last 48 h, there was no correlation between the duration of EN interruption and the GAA. The absence of EN was not associated with an empty stomach. At the time of extubation, the incidence of full stomach was high and not associated with the fasting characteristics (duration/absence of EN). Our results support the notions that fasting before airway management procedures is not a universal paradigm and that gastric ultrasound might represent a useful tool in the tailoring process.

Anaesthetists must be aware of a potentially dangerous side effect of the drug: decreased gastric emptying. This is caused by effects on gastric smooth muscle, mediated by the vagal afferent nerves. This is especially relevant in the peri-operative setting where pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents is a recognised complication. Here, we report two cases of peri-operative regurgitation of gastric contents in patients taking semaglutide. A patient taking semaglutide may have a full stomach despite compliance with routine pre-operative fasting guidelines. We consider how to manage patients receiving glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist therapy in the peri-operative period, including identifying those at high risk of regurgitation. Precautions such as rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation can be used, but gastric ultrasound may also be useful in the pre-operative environment to help identify patients at high risk of aspiration.",

It is typically associated with vascular or pancreatic pathologies, including pancreatic cysts, tumors, or pseudoaneurysms involving adjacent arteries such as the splenic or gastric artery. A 68-year-old male patient was evaluated for a pancreatic tail cyst detected on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The lesion was described as a 20-mm multilocular cystic formation with septations, raising suspicion of malignancy. HP was diagnosed following an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the pancreatic tail cystic lesion. The patient underwent EUS-FNA via a transgastric approach to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation. The procedure was complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding and later confirmed to be HP. The bleeding was managed conservatively, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable with spontaneous resolution of symptoms. This case underscores a rare but significant complication of EUS-FNA. Given the limited number of reported cases, further research is needed to establish the incidence, risk factors, and preventive measures for HP in similar clinical scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Semaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist known to delay gastric emptying. Despite a growing body of evidence, its peri-operative safety profile remains uncertain, particularly with regard to the risk of increased residual gastric content and aspiration of gastric contents during anaesthesia. We hypothesised that semaglutide interruption of ≤ 10 days before elective surgical procedures is insufficient to reduce or normalise the residual gastric content, despite fasting intervals that comply with current guidelines. In this prospective observational study, we recruited patients who received pre-operative once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide within 10 days of the procedure (semaglutide group) and control patients who had not been exposed to semaglutide (non-semaglutide group). On the day of surgery, all patients underwent pre-operative point-of-care gastric ultrasound to evaluate their residual gastric content. Increased residual gastric content was defined as any solid content or > 1.5 ml.kg We recruited 220 patients, 107 in the semaglutide group and 113 in the non-semaglutide group. Increased residual gastric content was found in 43/107 patients (40%) in the semaglutide group and 3/113 (3%) in the non-semaglutide group (p < 0.001). In propensity-weighted analysis, semaglutide use (OR 36.97, 95%CI 16.54-99.32), age (OR 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.98) and male sex (OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.29-4.06) were significantly associated with increased residual gastric content.

This study aims to investigate the role of ultrasound in predicting the gastric volume accurately. 176 patients who underwent upper gastric endoscopy after 12-hour fasting were examined by gastric US. The patients were ran- domly divided into 6 groups according to the volume of ingested semifluid meal: (1) empty stomach (no volume), (2) 50 mL, (3) 100 mL, (4) 200 mL, (5) 300 mL, and (6) 400 mL. Antral cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured by US after each ingestion. We found a strong linear correlation between antral CSA and gastric volume up to 200 mL. The diagnostic performance of ultra- sound was found to be more powerful in the supine position than in the right lateral position. A new mathematical model was established to predict gastric volume. The threshold value for antral cross-sectional area at risk of pulmonary aspiration was determined as 3.1 cm2 by sonographic measurement. Ultrasonography could be preferred to gastric endoscopy or scintigraphy in terms of non-invasiveness and easiness, although it still merits further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Gastric adenomyoma is a rare benign tumor composed of glandular structures and smooth muscle fibers. While some classify gastric adenomyoma as a hamartoma, others view it as an abortive form of heterotopic pancreas. Despite its benign nature, there is a risk of malignant transformation. Predominantly found in the antrum, gastric adenomyoma affects all ages but is most common in adults aged 40-60 years. Symptoms are nonspecific, and its similarity to other lesions complicates diagnosis. This paper aims to provide a review of medical literature on gastric adenomyoma and its diagnosis and treatment methods, along with presenting an additional case report on the same topic. We present the case of a 55-year-old Syrian man who experienced vomiting, weight loss, and chronic partial constipation. An obstructing mass in the pylorus was detected, and then an open surgery was performed to excise the lesion. A biopsy of the resected mass was obtained for histopathological examination. The final diagnosis of the lesion was pyloric-region adenomyoma with severe pyloric stenosis. After the successful surgery, the patient recovered without any recurrence or complications. Several diagnostic approaches are available, including radiological studies, endoscopic examination, and fine needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography. Treatment options involve endoscopic submucosal dissection and complete laparotomy resection. Further studies and thorough reviews are recommended to better understand the best clinical practices.

      "title": "Trauma in pregnancy: A narrative review of the current literature.",
      "abstract": "Trauma accounts for nearly half of all deaths of pregnant women. Pregnant women have distinct physiologic and anatomic characteristics which complicate their management following major trauma. This paper comprises a narrative review of the most recent literature informing the management of pregnant trauma patients. The incidence of trauma during pregnancy is 6-8%. The focus of clinical assessment must be on the mother, starting with the primary survey. During airway management, clinicians should consider early intubation if necessary and utilize gastric tubes to minimize the risk of aspiration. Pregnant women experience progesterone-mediated hyperventilation, and normal PaCO2 levels may portend imminent respiratory failure. Clinicians should utilize left lateral tilt in hypotensive pregnant women to displace the uterus off the inferior vena cava. Ultrasonography is an attractive imaging modality for pregnant women which is specific for ruling in intraabdominal hemorrhage but not sufficiently sensitive to exclude this diagnosis. Clinicians should not hesitate to order computed tomography imaging in unstable patients if there is diagnostic ambiguity. Cardiotocographic monitoring simultaneously assesses uterine contractions and fetal heart rate and should last at least 4 h for pregnant women following even minor abdominal trauma if their fetus has achieved viable gestational age (approximately 24 weeks). In the event of cardiac arrest, peri-mortem cesarean section may improve outcomes for the mother and fetus alike. Unique specific complications include uterine rupture and placental abruption, which require emergent resuscitation and obstetrics consultation for definitive management. Emergency clinicians should maintain a low threshold for transfer to a tertiary care center given correlations between even isolated and relatively minor traumatic injuries with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. Trauma is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Emergency clinicians must understand the evaluation and management of pregnant trauma patients.",

      "abstract": "There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal general anaesthetic technique for manual removal of the placenta after vaginal delivery. Using ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum, this study aimed to assess the change in gastric contents during vaginal delivery and to determine the prevalence of stomach at risk for pulmonary aspiration in the immediate postpartum period before placental delivery. In this prospective multicentre cohort study, antral ultrasonography was performed at full cervical dilatation within the thirty minutes preceding the beginning of expulsive efforts and after vaginal birth, before placental delivery. High-risk gastric content was defined as the visualisation of any solid content in the antrum or antral cross-sectional area in the semi-recumbent position (SR-CSA) > 608 mm². Twenty-six women were included and analysed. There was a significant decrease in both the proportion of patients with solid gastric content and the SR-CSA between the two-ultrasound examinations. Twenty-one patients (80.8%) exhibited a decrease in the SR-CSA during vaginal delivery. The prevalence of stomach at risk for pulmonary aspiration was significantly lower after vaginal delivery than before vaginal delivery (23.1% vs. 57.7%, P = 0.0004). Our results suggest that gastric emptying is at least partially preserved during vaginal birth. Nevertheless, almost a quarter of women did have high-risk gastric content in the immediate postpartum period. Point-of-care antral ultrasonography may be of interest for the fast assessment of the gastric content status when a general anaesthesia is required for manual removal of retained placenta.",

Focused cardiac ultrasound has gained interest as a potential tool for predicting postspinal hypotension through predelivery inferior vena cava collapsibility assessment. POCUS is also valuable for evaluating shock and cardiovascular compromise, aiding in the diagnosis and clinical management of amniotic fluid embolism and maternal cardiomyopathy. Gastric ultrasound can be performed qualitatively, aids aspiration risk assessment, and can be used in studies evaluating drug effects on gastric contents and antral cross-sectional area. Robust training programs are essential to equip obstetric anesthesiologists with sustainable POCUS skill sets. POCUS is associated with reduced neuraxial block placement times, provides critical hemodynamic data in patients with amniotic fluid embolism and cardiomyopathy, and allows gastric content evaluation for aspiration risk assessment. Expanding structured training and research is crucial to maximizing its clinical utility.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration is one of the important complications of general anesthesia, although infrequent as well as accompanying high morbidity and mortality. The volume of gastric content is considered as a risk factor in this regard. Therefore, it is normally mostly recommend to consider proper fasting time before induction of general anesthesia. This study was conducted to assess the effect of metoclopramide on reducing gastric contents in patients with incomplete fasting before induction of general anesthesia. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on patients with urgent surgical indications with incomplete NPO time. Every other patient received metoclopramide or placebo. Patients in the intervention group received 10 mg (2 ml) of intravenous metoclopramide, and patients in the control group received 2 ml of distilled water as a placebo. Patients in both groups underwent ultrasonography before starting surgery by an expert radiologist to calculate gastric antral grade (GAG) and cross-sectional antral area (CSA). These measurements were then taken for the second time 30 minutes after intervention, before starting the surgery. The values were compared statistically. The data of 60 patients were analyzed, of which 30 were in each group. The mean age, body mass index, type of the last consumed food (solid or fluid), NPO time in the two groups were not significantly different (P value > 0.05). The number of patients in the metoclopramide group with higher GAG (P value = 0.001) and the mean CSA (P value = 0.004) before the intervention was more than the control group. The GAG and mean CSA after intervention were not significantly different between the two groups; but the mean difference of decrease in CSA in the metoclopramide group was more than the control group (4.3 vs. 0.99; P value = 0.001), and changes of GAG after intervention to lower levels in the metoclopramide group was more than the control group (P value < 0.05). In the current study in which ultrasonographic indexes, including GAG and CSA, were assessed as a suboptimal gastric emptying test method, it was found that metoclopramide could accelerate gastric emptying compared to placebo in patients with incomplete fasting before induction of general anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to compare gastric ultrasound assessments between young and elderly patients, to determine whether the cross-section area (CSA) cutoff values for elderly and young patients should be different, and to suggest CSA cutoff values for elderly patients. This study evaluated the data of 120 patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia between July 2019 and August 2020. Demographic and gastric ultrasound assessment data were retrieved. Patients were divided into the elderly group (n = 58, age: ≥65 years) and young group (n = 62, age: <65 years). The CSAs in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions (RLDP), semiquantitative 3-point Perlas grade (grades 0, 1, and 2), and gastric volume (GV) were determined. CSAs according to different Perlas grades were compared between the 2 groups. To compare normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, Student t test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used, respectively. Categorical data were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built for the CSAs to predict pulmonary aspiration. The CSA cutoff values for predicting a high risk of pulmonary aspiration in both the groups were determined. Among patients with Perlas grade 0, the CSAsupine (P = .002) and CSARLDP (P = .002) were greater in the elderly group than in the young group. The specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of the CSA decreased when the CSA cutoff value for the young group was applied to the elderly group. The CSA cutoff values for the elderly group were: CSAsupine, 6.92 cm2 and CSARLDP, 10.65 cm2. The CSA of the empty stomach was greater in elderly patients than in young patients. We suggest that the following CSA cutoff values should be used for predicting pulmonary aspiration risk in elderly patients: CSAsupine, 6.92 cm2 and CSARLDP, 10.65 cm2.",

Criteria for diagnosis of aerophagia in dogs are >1/3 of bolus volume containing air or ingested air resulting in gastric distention (>1/3 of end gastric volume). Aerophagia is highlighted during eating and drinking. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) document aerophagia in dogs, but the incidence, clinical signs (CS), and associated disorders are unknown. Identify the incidence of aerophagia, compare CS between dogs with and without aerophagia, and identify associated and predisposing disorders using VFSS. A total of 120 client-owned dogs. Sequential VFSS and associated medical records from dogs presenting to veterinary teaching hospitals at Auburn University and the University of Missouri were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests, odds ratios (OR), and multiple logistic regression (P < .05). The incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of aerophagia was 40% (31.7-48.9). Dogs with mixed CS (gastrointestinal [GI] and respiratory; P < .001, 58.3%) were more likely to have aerophagia than dogs with exclusively respiratory CS (25%). Aerophagia was significantly more common in brachycephalic dogs (P = .01; 45.8% vs 13.8%), dogs with nonbrachycephalic upper airway obstruction (P < .001; 33.3% vs 4.1%), pathologic penetration and aspiration (P-A) scores (P = .04; 41.6% vs 23.6%), and gagging (P < .001; 25% vs 11.7%). Mixed CS (P = .01), brachycephaly (P < .001), and upper airway obstruction (P < .001) were independent predictors of aerophagia. Aerophagia was common, particularly in dogs with mixed CS. Brachycephalic dogs and dogs with upper airway obstruction are predisposed. Aspiration risk was high, emphasizing overlapping upper aerodigestive pathways.",

      "abstract": "The aim of study is to evaluate the results of deployment of Percutaneous Radiological Gastrostomy (PRG), which is a good alternative to Surgical Gastrostomy (SG), with transoral approach in cases where Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) is contraindicated, difficult or unsuccessful, in patients with high risk of American Society of Anesthesiologists with four scores. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate the advantages of mushroom pull type catheters over push type gastrostomy catheters. This retrospective study included a total of 40 patients (18 females and 22 males) aged 21-92 years who underwent PRG with the antegrade transoral approach. PRG was performed by retrograde passing through the esophagus or snaring the guidewire from the stomach and taking out of the anterior abdominal wall. Patients' demographic data, indications for PRG, procedural outcomes and complications were screened and recorded. PRG was performed in 39 of 40 patients included in the study. Technical success rate was 97.5%. Procedure-dependent major complications such as death, aspiration, colon perforation, and deep abscess were not observed. Aspiration occurred in the first patient during the first feeding on the day after the procedure. Major complication rate was 2.5%. The total minor complication rate was 17.5% in 7 patients; parastomal leakage in 2 patients (5%), skin rash and infection in 3 (7.5%) patients, minor bleeding in 2 (5%) patients with oropharynx cancer, minimal bleeding from the gastrostomy catheter 1 week after the procedure in 1 (2.5%) patient. None of the cases had buried buffer. Tube functionality was preserved in all patients without any damage. Mushroom tip (pull type) gastrostomy catheter is a safe treatment method for patients requiring prolonged feeding because of wide diameter, endurance, long staying opening duration, less excessive dilatation and parastomal leakage, and no need for gastropexy. Lower cost and easier access are advantageous for mushroom tip pull type catheters compared to push type gastrostomy catheters in our country. The less invasive PRG is an alternative option in patients who are difficult to administer PEG, are at high anesthesia risk and cannot be sedated. This article is valuable in terms of its contribution to develop an alternative radiological method for the deployment of gastrostomy tubes in medical difficult patients. This method has shortened the duration of the procedure and increased the success rate in patients with difficulty in transition from the stomach to the esophagus or with difficulty in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Mushroom tip catheters can be placed successfully by radiological methods.",

      "abstract": "Gastric contents may contribute to patients' aspiration during anesthesia. Ultrasound can accurately assess the risk of gastric contents in patients undergoing sedative gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) procedures, but its efficiency is limited. Therefore, developing an accurate and efficient model to predict gastric contents in outpatients undergoing elective sedative GIE procedures is greatly desirable. This study retrospectively analyzed 1501 patients undergoing sedative GIE procedures. Gastric contents were observed under direct gastroscopic vision and suctioned through the endoscope. High-risk gastric contents were defined as having solid content or liquid volume > 25 ml and pH < 2.5; otherwise, they were considered low-risk gastric contents. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used to select the independent risk factors to predict high-risk gastric contents. Based on the selected independent risk factors, we assigned values to each independent risk factor and established a novel nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was verified in the testing cohort by the metrics of discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. In addition, an online accessible web calculator was constructed. We found BMI, cerebral infarction, cirrhosis, male, age, diabetes, and gastroesophageal reflux disease were risk factors for gastric contents. The AUROCs were 0.911 and 0.864 in the development and testing cohort, respectively. Moreover, the nomogram showed good calibration ability. Decision curve analysis and Clinical impact curve demonstrated that the predictive nomogram was clinically useful. The website of the nomogram was https://medication.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/. This study demonstrates that clinical variables can be combined with algorithmic techniques to predict gastric contents in outpatients. Nomogram was constructed from routine variables, and the web calculator had excellent clinical applicability to assess the risk of gastric contents accurately and efficiently in outpatients, assist anesthesiologists in assessment and identify the most appropriate patients for ultrasound.",

      "abstract": "The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) by patients undergoing surgery and procedures requiring anesthesia has become a topic of significant concern for perioperative providers because of the potential increased risk of aspiration resulting from the medication's effect of delaying gastric emptying. There is currently a lack of high-quality data regarding the safety of GLP-1 RAs in patients undergoing surgery, which has led to variations in practice. We performed an internet search of society-endorsed statements and guidelines related to perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs, focusing on the top 20 countries with the largest anesthesiology societies determined by membership data from the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists. We excluded articles and websites that were not in English. Our search revealed endorsed statements from fourteen major anesthesiology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology societies. There was considerable variation between societies in the recommendations and guidance for withholding these medications before surgery, the duration of withholding, assessment of the need for avoiding deep sedation or general anesthesia, use of rapid sequence intubation, need for prolonged fasting periods and clear fluid before a nil per os period, recognition of signs and symptoms for aspiration risk, the management of glucose in the perioperative period, and the use of point-of-care ultrasound for risk assessment. Society-endorsed statements and guidelines provide varying recommendations on the perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs. The insights gained from this comparative analysis may help guide clinical practice, develop institutional practice guidelines, and direct future research efforts. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: L’utilisation d’agonistes des récepteurs (AR) du peptide-1 de type glucagon (GLP-1) par les personnes bénéficiant d’une intervention chirurgicale et de procédures nécessitant une anesthésie est devenue un sujet de préoccupation important pour les prestataires de soins périopératoires en raison de l’augmentation du risque potentiel d’aspiration résultant de l’effet du médicament, qui provoque un retard de la vidange gastrique. Il existe actuellement un manque de données de haute qualité concernant l’innocuité des AR GLP-1 chez les patient·es bénéficiant d’une intervention chirurgicale, ce qui a mené à des variations dans la pratique. Nous avons réalisé une recherche sur Internet des déclarations et lignes directrices approuvées par les sociétés médicales concernant la prise en charge périopératoire des AR GLP-1, en nous concentrant sur les 20 pays comptant les plus grandes sociétés d’anesthésiologie, déterminées par les données sur les membres de la Fédération mondiale des sociétés d’anesthésiologistes. Nous avons exclu les articles et les sites Web qui n’étaient pas en anglais. Nos recherches ont révélé des déclarations approuvées par quatorze grandes sociétés d’anesthésiologie, d’endocrinologie et de gastro-entérologie. Il y avait des variations considérables entre les sociétés en matière de recommandations et de directives concernant l’abstention de ces médicaments avant la chirurgie, la durée de l’abstention, l’évaluation de la nécessité d’éviter la sédation profonde ou l’anesthésie générale, l’utilisation de l’intubation en séquence rapide, la nécessité de périodes de jeûne prolongées et de liquides clairs avant une période nil per os, la reconnaissance des signes et symptômes du risque d’aspiration, la prise en charge de la glycémie pendant la période périopératoire et l’utilisation de l’échographie ciblée pour l’évaluation des risques. Les déclarations et les lignes directrices approuvées par les sociétés médicales fournissent des recommandations variées sur la prise en charge périopératoire des AR GLP-1. Les connaissances acquises grâce à cette analyse comparative pourraient aider à orienter la pratique clinique, à élaborer des lignes directrices de pratique institutionnelles et à guider les efforts de recherche futurs.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative pulmonary aspiration (PPA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. During anesthesia, airway reflexes become depressed, placing patients at risk of PPA. Gastric ultrasonography (GUS) can be used to qualitatively differentiate between solids, liquids, and empty gastric contents. The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of GUS in identifying gastric contents after participants were randomly assigned to consume 1 donut, drink 360 mL of water, or remain fasted (n=60 each group). Ultrasonography was performed by a blinded scanner, and qualitative findings were recorded by 2 sonography examiners and the primary scanner. Findings from the water group included a sensitivity of 95% to 100% and specificity of 87.5% to 90% for identification of liquids. Interrater reliability results yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=.781 for the solid group; ICC=.950 for the fluid group; and ICC=.761 for the fasted group. Statistically significant differences were found for the effect that body mass index classifications had on sensitivity and specificity of GUS for predicting gastric content. Results of this study demonstrated that GUS is highly sensitive, specific, and reliable with low false-positive and false-negative rates in the identification of fluid gastric content.",

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS With an increased risk of perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.",

      "title": "Glucose-Lowering Agents Developed in the Last Two Decades and Their Perioperative Implications.",
      "abstract": "The last two decades have provided far more options f both patients and their physicians in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. While dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been approved for nearly two decades, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are relatively new. Of interest to perioperative physicians, these drugs present specific perioperative concerns, prompting many societies to issue guidelines. Retained gastric contents due to slow gastric emptying is a significant drawback of GLP-1RAs, increasing the risk of aspiration. Recommendations include withholding GLP-1RAs for a predefined period of time, performing gastric ultrasound to evaluate gastric contents, modifying anesthesia management, particularly with regard to the airway, or canceling the scheduled (elective) surgery or procedure. SGLT-2is are known to increase the risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis. The benefits of both GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is extend beyond the treatment of diabetes. As a result, perioperative physicians may encounter their use outside of their traditional indications. SGLT-2is are being used extensively to treat heart failure and obesity, for example. There have been other developments as well. For instance, Imeglimin, a variant of metformin available in Japan and India, Icodec, a once-weekly basal insulin formulation, and IcoSema, a once-weekly combination of Icodec plus semaglutide, are all being explored, although in their early stages or facing approval challenges.",

Our primary objective was to assess the diagnostic performance of clinical judgment for the preoperative assessment of full stomach in urgent patients compared to gastric point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS). Our secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with PoCUS full stomach in urgent patients. We led a prospective observational study at our Hospital, between January and July 2016. Adult patients admitted for urgent surgery were eligible. Patients with altered gastric sonoanatomy, interventions reducing stomach content, impossible lateral decubitus were excluded. Clinical judgment and risk factors of full stomach were collected before gastric PoCUS measurements. Ultrasonographic full stomach was defined by solid contents or liquid volume ≥ 1.5 ml kg The prevalence of clinical and PoCUS full stomach in 196 included patients was 29% and 27%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 42% (95% CI: 32.3-52.6%) and 79% (95% CI: 74.9-83.4%), respectively. Patients with PoCUS full stomach were clinically misdiagnosed in 55% of cases. PoCUS full stomach was associated with abdominal or gynaecological-obstetrical surgery (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5-8.8, P < 0.01) but not with fasting durations. Positive solid intake after illness onset with respect to 6-h solid fasting rule was associated with PoCUS low-risk gastric content (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, P = 0.03). Clinical judgment showed poor-to-moderate performance in urgent surgical patients for the diagnosis of full stomach. Gastric PoCUS should be used to assess risk of full stomach in this population.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration syndrome remains a significant complication of general anesthesia, particularly in unfasted patients. Gastric point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) allows for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of gastric content, providing a safe and reliable method to assess gastric emptying and reduce the risk of aspiration during general anesthesia. The survey was distributed to Belgian certified anesthesiologists and trainees between April 2020 and June 2021. Participants received a simulated clinical case of a patient at risk of gastric aspiration, created and approved by two certified anesthesiologists trained to perform gastric POCUS. The objectives of this study were to assess recognition of high-risk clinical situations for gastric aspiration, awareness of the gastric POCUS and its indications, and knowledge of the technical and practical conditions of the procedure among respondents trained in the technique. Furthermore, the study assessed the state of training in gastric POCUS, the desire for education, and the practical availability of ultrasound equipment. The survey used conditional branching to ensure unbiased responses to POCUS-related questions. It included multiple-choice questions, quantitative variables, and 5-point Likert scales. The margin of error was calculated using Daniel's formula, corrected for a finite population. The survey was conducted among 323 anesthesiologists. Only 20.8% (27) recognized the risk of a full stomach based on the patient's history. Anesthesiologists who recognized the indication for gastric POCUS and were trained in the procedure demonstrated good recall of the practical conditions for performing the procedure and interpreting the results. Only 13.08% (31) of all respondents had received training in gastric POCUS, while 72.57% (172) expressed interest in future training. Furthermore, 80.17% (190) of participants had access to adequate ultrasound equipment and 78.90% (187) supported teaching gastric POCUS to anesthesia trainees. This survey offers insight into the epidemiology, clinical recognition, knowledge, and utilization of gastric POCUS among Belgian anesthesia professionals. The results emphasize the significance of proper equipment and training to ensure the safe and effective implementation of gastric POCUS in anesthesia practice. Additional efforts should focus on improving training and promoting the integration of gastric POCUS into daily clinical practice.",

      "title": "Ultrasound Assessment of Gastric Volume in Parturients After High-Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy.",
      "abstract": "High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy is widely used in critical care obstetrics to improve oxygenation. Much of the benefit of HFNO is linked to the creation of modest levels of positive airway pressure. Pregnant women are generally considered to be at high risk of regurgitation and aspiration. It is unknown whether HFNO may cause gas insufflation into the stomach and further increase this risk. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically evaluate the possible safety effects of HFNO on gastric volume in healthy fasted parturients. Sixty fasted parturients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were enrolled in an observer-blinded, prospective, interventional study. We used ultrasonography to assess changes of antral cross-sectional area (CSA) and gastric volume before and after a 20-minute treatment with HFNO at a rate of 50 L·min -1 . The primary outcome was the change in gastric volume from before to after HFNO therapy, and the secondary outcome was the distribution of antral grades. In semirecumbent right lateral position, the antral CSA at baseline and after treatment with HFNO was 3.81 (3.01-4.72) cm 2 and 3.79 (3.03-4.54) cm 2 , respectively. The estimated fluid volume at baseline and after treatment with HFNO was 38.51 (33.39-54.62) mL and 39.71 (32.00-52.82) mL, respectively. All participants had either a grade 0 or grade 1 antrum, and most of them had a grade 0 antrum. There was no significant difference in gastric volume and distribution of antral grades before and after HFNO therapy. Gastric air distension was not shown in any of the parturients either at baseline or after treatment with HFNO. Treatment with HFNO for 20 minutes at flow rates up to 50 L·min -1 did not increase gastric volume in term pregnant women breathing spontaneously when evaluated by gastric ultrasonography.",

      "abstract": "Although preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL) is generally regarded as safe, the significance of assessing gastric status by gastric ultrasound after PCL application has not been adequately explored in real-world clinical settings. Therefore, this study evaluated gastric status after PCL using gastric ultrasound and its potential role in enhancing patient safety within a large surgical cohort under Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. We retrospectively analyzed patients who received PCL and underwent hepatobiliary surgery within ERAS protocol between November 2018 to December 2023. The primary outcome was the incidence of an increased gastric content. Secondary outcomes included PCL compliance, gastric ultrasound data, fasting intervals, the incidence of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) and aspiration, and predictive factors for increased gastric content. Of the 1187 patients, the compliance rate for PCL applications within the ERAS protocol reached 88%, with 746 patients included in the final analysis. Fasting hours duration < 2 h in 7.2% of cases. The incidence of an increased gastric content was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-6.6%), observed in 36 patients. RSI was performed in all patients with an increased gastric content, with no aspiration reported. Multivariate logistic regression identified BMI as the only independent predictor of increased gastric content (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.77, P < 0.001). Patients receiving PCL within the ERAS protocol may be safe in clinical practice without an elevated risk of having an increased gastric content. However, individual variability and associated risk factors need consideration. Not applicable.",

      "abstract": "To systematically analyze the accuracy of ultrasonic techniques in assessing the nature of gastric contents and their volume. English-language articles that used ultrasonic techniques to assess the nature of gastric contents and their volume in patients were selected. In eligible studies, data were recalculated and analyzed for forest plots and subject summary curves of operating characteristics (SROC). Study quality was assessed using the diagnostic accuracy study quality assessment tool QUADAS-2. Publication bias was tested using funnel plots. Nine articles with a total of 523 study subjects were identified for this review. All studies were feasibility studies. The sensitivity of ultrasound assessment of gastric contents ranged from 53 to 100% and the specificity from 48 to 99%. The combined analysis yielded an area under the working characteristic curve for subjects of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 95-98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 84-99%), and a specificity of 88% (95% CI, 72-95%). There was a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies due to inter-operator differences and small sample sizes. Ultrasound techniques have high diagnostic accuracy in assessing the nature of gastric contents and their volume in patients. However, most of the studies were feasibility studies with small sample sizes, lacked standardization, and had high risk of bias. More studies are needed in the future to investigate the diagnostic performance of gastric ultrasound assessment techniques. Ultrasonography can be used to assess gastric contents, but standardized data integration and reporting are needed to account for the diagnostic capabilities of this technology. • Ultrasound is a safe and feasible tool for assessing gastric contents. • Ultrasound has good diagnostic performance for gastric contents. • There is still a certain heterogeneity within our analysis process; more research is needed in the future to improve our results.",

      "title": "Risk of pulmonary aspiration during semaglutide use and anesthesia in a fasting patient: a case report with tomographic evidence.",
      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration of gastric residues during anesthesia is a potentially fatal complication for which no specific treatment is available. The primary way to prevent its occurrence in the context of elective surgeries is adherence to fasting protocols. However, some clinical conditions can prolong the gastric emptying time, and the risk of aspiration may exist despite adequate fasting. Recognizing the risk factors for gastroparesis allows the adoption of preventive methods and is the primary way to reduce morbidity and mortality from pulmonary aspiration. In this scenario, the anesthesiologist can investigate the gastric content by using ultrasound, adjust the anesthetic technique, and even postpone elective surgeries. Here, we describe incidental computed tomography finding of solid contents in the stomach of a patient without prior identification of the risk factors for gastroparesis. The patient underwent elective renal nodule ablation under general anesthesia after fasting for 9 hours. During the procedure, solid contents in the stomach were noted on computed tomography. Subsequently, it was discovered that the patient had been using semaglutide for 6 days and had not disclosed this information. Semaglutide use may represent a new and significant risk factor for anesthesia-related pulmonary aspiration. Until studies provide information on the appropriate perioperative management of patients using semaglutide, anesthesiologists need to adopt preventive measures to avoid aspiration. Awareness of this potential association and open communication among patients, physicians, and anesthesia teams are essential for enhancing patient safety.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have become increasingly popular as both diabetic and weight loss therapies. One effect of this class of medication is delayed gastric emptying, which may impact the risk of aspiration during anesthesia delivery. In this prospective study, we used gastric ultrasound to evaluate the presence of solid gastric contents in both supine and lateral positions after an eight-hour fast in those taking GLP-1RA compared with controls. Participants underwent a second ultrasound evaluation two hours later after drinking 12 fluid ounces of water (approximately 350 mL). Twenty adults voluntarily enrolled, giving a total of ten participants in each group. In the supine position, 70% of semaglutide participants and 10% of control participants had solids present on gastric ultrasound (risk ratio [RR], 3.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 9.65; P = 0.02.) In the lateral position, 90% of semaglutide participants and 20% of control participants had solids identified on gastric ultrasound (RR, 7.36; 95% CI, 1.13 to 47.7; P = 0.005). Two hours after drinking clear liquids, the two groups did not differ in the lateral position, but in the supine position, 90% of control group participants were rated as empty compared with only 30% of semaglutide group participants (P = 0.02). This study provides preliminary evidence that GLP-1RAs may affect gastric emptying and residual gastric contents following an overnight fast and two hours after clear liquids, which may have implications for aspiration risk during anesthetic care. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Les agonistes des récepteurs du peptide-1 de type glucagon (GLP-1) (AR-GLP-1) sont de plus en plus populaires comme traitements du diabète et pour la perte de poids. L’un des effets de cette classe de médicaments est le retard de la vidange gastrique, ce qui peut avoir un impact sur le risque d’aspiration pendant l’administration de l’anesthésie. MéTHODE: Dans cette étude prospective, nous avons utilisé l’échographie gastrique pour évaluer la présence de contenu gastrique solide en décubitus dorsal et latéral après un jeûne de huit heures chez les personnes prenant des AR-GLP-1 par rapport à un groupe témoin. Les participant·es ont passé une deuxième échographie deux heures plus tard, après avoir bu 12 onces liquides d’eau (environ 350 mL). RéSULTATS: Vingt personnes adultes se sont inscrites volontairement, soit un total de dix participant·es dans chaque groupe. En décubitus dorsal, 70 % des personnes du groupe sémaglutide et 10 % des personnes du groupe témoin présentaient des solides à l’échographie gastrique (risque relatif [RR], 3,50; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 %, 1,26 à 9,65; P = 0,02). En décubitus latéral, 90 % des personnes du groupe sémaglutide et 20 % des personnes du groupe témoin présentaient des solides à l’échographie gastrique (RR, 7,36; IC 95 %, 1,13 à 47,7; P = 0,005). Deux heures après avoir bu des liquides clairs, le contenu gastrique évalué ne différait pas entre les deux groupes en position latérale, mais en décubitus dorsal, l’estomac de 90 % des participant·es du groupe témoin a été jugé vide, comparativement à seulement 30 % chez les participant·es du groupe sémaglutide (P = 0,02). CONCLUSION: Cette étude procure des données préliminaires selon lesquelles les AR-GLP-1 pourraient affecter la vidange gastrique et le contenu gastrique résiduel après un jeûne d’une nuit et deux heures après l’ingestion de liquides clairs, ce qui pourrait avoir des implications quant au risque d’aspiration pendant les soins anesthésiques.",

      "abstract": "Cricoid pressure has been used as a component of the rapid sequence induction and intubation technique. However, concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness and safety of cricoid pressure. Paratracheal pressure, a potential alternative to cricoid pressure to prevent regurgitation of gastric contents or aspiration, has been studied to be more effective to cricoid pressure in preventing gastric insufflation during positive pressure ventilation. However, to adopt paratracheal compression into our practice, adverse effects including its effect on the glottic view during direct laryngoscopy should be studied. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial comparing paratracheal and cricoid pressures for any adverse effects on the view during direct laryngoscopy, together with other secondary outcome measures. In total, 140 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia randomly received paratracheal pressure (paratracheal group) or cricoid pressure (cricoid group) during anesthesia induction. The primary end point was the incidence of deteriorated laryngoscopic view, evaluated by modified Cormack-Lehane grade with a predefined noninferiority margin of 15%. Secondary end points included percentage of glottic opening score, ease of mask ventilation, change in ventilation volume and peak inspiratory pressure during mechanical mask ventilation, ease of tracheal intubation, and resistance encountered while advancing the tube into the glottis. The position of the esophagus was assessed by ultrasound in both groups to determine whether pressure applied to the respective area would be likely to result in esophageal compression. All secondary outcomes were tested for superiority, except percentage of glottic opening score, which was tested for noninferiority. Paratracheal pressure was noninferior to cricoid pressure regarding the incidence of deterioration of modified Cormack-Lehane grade (0% vs 2.9%; absolute risk difference, -2.9%; 95% confidence interval, -9.9 to 2.6, P <.0001). Mask ventilation, measured on an ordinal scale, was found to be easier (ie, more likely to have a lower score) with paratracheal pressure than with cricoid pressure (OR, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.79; P = .008). The increase in peak inspiratory pressure was significantly less in the paratracheal group than in the cricoid group during mechanical mask ventilation (median [min, max], 0 [-1, 1] vs 0 [-1, 23]; P = .001). The differences in other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant between the groups. The anatomical position of the esophagus was more suitable for compression in the paratracheal region, compared to the cricoid cartilage region. Paratracheal pressure was noninferior to cricoid pressure with respect to the effect on glottic view during direct laryngoscopy.",

      "abstract": "Delayed bowel function (DBF) and postoperative ileus (POI) are common gastrointestinal complications after surgery. There is no reliable imaging study to help diagnose these complications, forcing clinicians to rely solely on patient history and physical exam. Gastric point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a simple bedside imaging technique to evaluate gastric contents but has not been evaluated in postoperative patients. Twenty colorectal patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Patients were categorized as either full or empty stomach based upon their postoperative day one gastric POCUS exams and previously published definitions. The primary outcome was GI-3 recovery, a dual end point defined as tolerance of solid food and either flatus or bowel movement. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, emesis, time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, nasogastric tube placement, aspiration events, and mortality. Nine of 20 patients had a full stomach postoperatively. Patients with full stomachs were younger and received greater perioperative opioid doses (74.0 ± 28.2 v 42.6 ± 32.9 morphine equivalents, P = 0.0363) compared to empty stomach patients. GI-3 recovery occurred significantly later for patients with postoperative day 1 full stomachs (2.1 ± 0.4 versus 1 ± 0 days, P = 0.00091). Based upon this pilot study, gastric POCUS may hold promise as a noninvasive and simple bedside modality to potentially help identify colorectal patients at risk for postoperative DBF and POI and should be evaluated in a larger study.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (E-GISTs) are often diagnosed early due to complaints such as dysphagia and are rarely found to be huge in size. Here, we report the treatment of a case of huge E-GIST successfully resected by minimally invasive surgery after neoadjuvant imatinib therapy. An 86-year-old male patient with a 3-month history of dysphagia was referred to our hospital because of a suspected mediastinal tumor on chest X-ray. The chest computed tomography scan revealed a huge solid tumor, of about 100 mm in diameter, protruding into the left thoracic cavity. Histopathological examination results of fine-needle aspiration biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a c-kit and CD34-positive esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The patient received neoadjuvant therapy with imatinib (400 mg/day) to reduce the size of the tumor and prevent rupture during resection. After 28 days of oral administration of imatinib, the tumor size decreased. However, the patient refused to continue treatment with imatinib and therefore underwent mediastino-laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. We successfully resected the tumor completely with mediastino-laparoscopic surgical techniques. Esophageal reconstruction was performed using a gastric tube in the posterior sternal route. After an uneventful postoperative course, the patient was discharged postoperative day 14. Immunohistochemical findings of the resected specimen showed that the tumor cells were positive for c-kit, DOG-1 and CD34 and negative for smooth muscle actin and S100. Hybrid surgical procedure utilizing mediastino-laparoscopy might be useful for high-risk patient with esophageal tumors.",

A pathological examination using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration(EUS-FNA) revealed gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST). The combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with the non-exposure technique(CLEAN-NET)was undertaken via a 2.5 cm single umbilical incision. The tumor was identified by EGD, and the scheduled dissected line was confirmed both from the mucosal and serosa side with an endoscope and laparoscope, respectively. The serosal and muscular layers were incised with an electric knife from outside the gastric wall; hypertonic saline solution was locally injected to swell the submucosal layer; partial gastric resection was performed with an automatic suture device without capsule damage. The operation time was 61 minutes, and there was blood less. The patient was discharged 6 days after the operation without complications. Histopathological findings showed GIST, 16× 14 mm, c-kit(+), CD34(+). The tumor was very low risk, as per the modified-Fletcher classification.

      "abstract": "We hypothesized that the preoperative administration of oral erythromycin and metoclopramide would reduce the risk of high gastric volume and contents, evaluated by bedside gastric ultrasonography in non-laboring pregnant subjects preparing for elective cesarean delivery. This randomized double-blinded study included 150 parturients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. They received flavored water with oral erythromycin 400 mg (group E), oral metoclopramide 10 mg (group M), or placebo (group C) after standard meal ingestion, followed by ultrasonography measurement of gastric volume before and hourly after drug administration. The primary outcome was the mean gastric volume after six hours of fasting. Secondary outcomes included measuring gastric contents hourly until a safe level and assessing aspiration risk. Significant differences in mean (±SD) gastric volume (mL/kg) were observed after six hours among groups C, E, and M, with values of 1.05 ± 0.49, 0.71 ± 0.46, and 0.75 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.001). Six hours after ingesting a standard meal, low-risk gastric contents were observed in 42 parturients (84%) in Group E, 41 parturients (82%) in Group M, and 31 parturients (62%) in Group C (P = 0.017). At both the fifth- and sixth-hours post-ingestion, parturients in Groups E and M demonstrated a significantly higher gastric emptying fraction compared to Group C. Additionally, parturients in Groups E and M exhibited the shortest half-time gastric emptying and gastric emptying time.

      "abstract": "Gastritis cystica profunda (GCP), commonly observed in remnant gastric anastomosis, is associated with developing gastric cancer. This case report describes a patient with GCP in a previously unoperated stomach that mimicked a pyloric submucosal tumor and caused anorexia, which is rare in clinical practice. A 72-year-old woman presented with loss of appetite and weight. Gastroscopy detected a 20 mm diameter submucosal tumor near the pylorus. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identified a cystic lesion, unlike a usual submucosal tumor in the stomach. The diagnosis was difficult, even with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Surgery was performed for diagnosis and treatment. The lesion was resected using a submucosal dissection technique after an incision of the gastric wall during open laparotomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of GCP and revealed no dysplasia or cancer. Anorexia resolved after the surgery. Residual or recurrent lesions were not detected during follow-up examinations performed 1 year after surgery. GCP occurring in a previously unoperated stomach as a macroscopic lesion like a submucosal tumor causing some symptoms is rare. GCP is associated with a risk of developing cancer. Therefore, careful evaluation and management during treatment are required.",

      "abstract": "The assessment of gastric content and volume using bedside ultrasound (US) has become a useful tool in emergency departments, anesthesiology departments and inpatient wards, as it provides a rapid and dynamic assessment of the gastric content of patients, which, allows making decisions regarding the risk of regurgitation or the need to adjust the strategy used to induce general anesthesia in patients with a full stomach. This assessment consists of two evaluations: a qualitative one, in which the status of the antrum, in terms of gastric content, is classified into three categories (empty, liquid content and full), and a quantitative one, where gastric volume is estimated. The objective of this study was to estimate the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in ultrasound assessment of gastric content and volume in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. A total of 41 patients were included and each examiner performed 64 gastric US (n = 128). Participants' average age was 56.5 years (SD ± 12.6) and 63.4% were men. Regarding the qualitative evaluation of the antrum, in supine position both examiners classified the gastric content as grade 0 in 1 gastric US (1.5%), grade 1 in 4 gastric US (6.2%) and grade 2 in 59 (92.1%). Regarding intra-observer variability in the measurement of the area of the antrum, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), the difference of means between measurements and the 95% limits of agreement of Bland and Altman values were 0.95 (95% CI 0.940-0.977), - 0.47 cm The assessment of gastric content and volume using bedside US in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation and receiving enteral nutrition showed a good intra and inter-rater reliability.

      "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has emerged as the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer, esophageal cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer which can not only improve the rate of local control but also induce pathological complete response in some patients. For patients who have achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy, the watch & wait strategy and organ preservation could reduce unnecessary surgery and minimize the risk of postoperative complications, meanwhile greatly improve patients' quality of life without affecting the oncologic outcome. At present, a variety of methods, including white light endoscopy, endoscopic forceps biopsy, image enhanced endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration, endoscopic submucosal dissection, artificial intelligence assisted technology, etc., have become important assistance for the evaluation of tumor response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and have been widely used in clinical practice. This review will briefly introduce the application of the endoscopic approaches mentioned above and some novel endoscopic techniques and developing trends in response evaluation for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, esophageal cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 新辅助放化疗作为局部进展期直肠癌、食管癌及食管胃结合部癌的标准治疗方案，不但能提高肿瘤局部控制率，还能使部分患者获得病理完全缓解。对新辅助治疗后达到临床完全缓解的患者，等待观察策略和器官保留理念可在不降低肿瘤学疗效的前提下，减少不必要的手术创伤并降低并发症发生风险，大幅提高患者生活质量。目前，包括白光内镜、内镜下活检、内镜图像增强技术、超声内镜检查、超声内镜引导下针吸活检术、内镜黏膜下剥离术和人工智能辅助技术等在内的多种手段，已成为新辅助放化疗后疗效评估的重要参考依据，并在临床中得到广泛应用。本文将针对临床中目前常用的以及新型内镜技术，在直肠癌、食管癌及食管胃结合部癌新辅助放化疗疗效评估中的应用及最新进展进行介绍。.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration-related syndromes comprise a broad spectrum of diseases affecting the airways and lung parenchyma resulting from inadvertent entry of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the respiratory tract. The diagnosis can be challenging given lack of self-reported symptoms and unwitnessed or silent aspiration events. Aspiration is a common finding in healthy individuals suggesting that host defenses play a critical role in the pathophysiology. In the absence of strict criterion, a high index of suspicion is necessary based on recognition of established risk factors and identification of characteristic imaging findings. Conditions predisposing to altered levels of consciousness and neuromuscular weakness can lead to dysphagia, impaired cough reflux, and subsequent aspiration. The most salient feature on imaging is the anatomic location of the abnormalities, with the superior segments of the lower lobes and posterior segments of upper lobes involved in the recumbent position, and basilar segments of lower lobes in the upright position. Acute syndromes include pneumonia, pneumonitis, and foreign body aspiration. In the more indolent form of aspiration, bronchiectasis, diffuse bronchiolitis, and interstitial lung disease can develop. A detailed understanding of associated radiographic findings for these syndromes can help to implicate aspiration as the cause for imaging abnormalities and ultimately optimize patient management.",

      "abstract": "Gastric residual volume (GRV) has been widely used in clinical practice for a long time as an essential indicator of gastrointestinal motility and enteral nutrition tolerance. Recent studies have questioned the rationality of monitoring GRV routinely in critically ill patients. A \"one size fits all\" principle is not an optimal solution in the clinical practice of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients because of the huge heterogeneity of the intensive care unit (ICU) population. Each method of monitoring GRV has advantages and disadvantages. With the widespread clinical application of harmless monitoring technologies such as ultrasound, the gastric suctioning method maybe used less and less. The management of enteral nutrition focuses on identifying the factors and triggers of gastric retention, attempting to solve them from the perspective of prevention and elimination of high-risk factors for aspiration and analysis of pathophysiological mechanisms, eliminating all negative hindering factors, and actively promoting the concept of \"creating conditions for enteral nutrition\". As a critical nutrition management team, it is necessary to pay attention to the continuous improvement of enteral nutrition management culture and rationally use diversified management strategies, which may be more important than monitoring GRV.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative pulmonary aspiration risk increases with increased preoperative gastric volume; hence traditionally, healthy children are kept fasted overnight before surgery. Current guidelines recommend 2-h clear fluids fasting prior to anesthesia. However, emerging evidence favors allowing 3 ml/kg clear fluids up to 1-h before anesthesia. We compared the gastric volume and gastric emptying time after ingestion of 3 ml/kg and 5 ml/kg of clear fluids. The present study enrolled 44 children, aged between 6 and 14 years. On the day of surgery, baseline gastric volume was estimated using ultrasound and patients were randomly allocated into two groups of equal number, that is, Group 3 and Group 5 (patients received 3 ml/kg and 5 ml/kg 5% Dextrose respectively). Repeated gastric ultrasound was performed at every 5 min until the gastric volume reached baseline levels. The primary objective of the study was to compare gastric emptying time. Secondary objectives included comparison of antral cross-sectional area and gastric volume. The demographic profile, preoperative fasting duration for clear fluids, and baseline gastric volume were comparable between groups. In both groups, compared to baseline the antral cross-sectional area and gastric volume increased significantly following fluid ingestion and then decreased exponentially to reach baseline within 1-h. The median (IQR) (range) gastric emptying time (minutes) [35.0 (28.8, 40.0) (20.0-45.0) in group 3 and 40.0 (28.8, 45.0) (20.0-50.0) in group 5] and emptying half-time (minutes) [17.0 (15.7, 21.5) (14.4-24.0) in group 3 and 18.6 (16.0, 22.0) (15.1-23.8) in group 5] were comparable [median difference -5 (95% CI -7.8 to 2.1) and -1.5 (95% CI -2.3 to 1.0), respectively] (p = .16 and p = .44, respectively). As the gastric volume returned to baseline within 1-h even after ingesting 5 ml/kg clear fluids, the preoperative fasting time can be reduced to 1-h and healthy children undergoing elective procedure can be safely allowed to drink up to 5 ml/kg clear fluids.",

      "abstract": "Patients with risk factors for gastroparesis are at increased risk for aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree. Current American Society of Anesthesiologists fasting guidelines use subjective measures to determine aspiration risk. A gastric ultrasound protocol can identify patients with risk factors for gastroparesis and determine the need to perform a point-of-care gastric ultrasound to objectively assess gastric antral contents. This enables the anaesthesia provider to assess patients at increased risk for aspiration. Additionally, many patients who present for surgery with risk factors for gastroparesis have an empty gastric antrum. Thus, the gastric ultrasound protocol checklist saves time and manpower requirements of anaesthesia staff without impacting patient safety or perioperative efficiency. A convenience sample of 40 patients consented for surgery was assessed using a screening tool to identify those at risk for gastroparesis and possible aspiration. Patients deemed at risk received a gastric ultrasound examination to evaluate for the presence of gastric contents. Over 12% of these patients had solid food gastric contents on exam. All patients with solid food gastric contents had an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification of 3 or higher, and two or more risk factors for gastroparesis.",

      "title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on Endoscopic Management of Perforations in Gastrointestinal Tract: Expert Review.",
      "abstract": "BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: For all procedures, especially procedures carrying an increased risk for perforation, a thorough discussion between the endoscopist and the patient (preferably together with the patient's family) should include details of the procedural techniques and risks involved. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The area of perforation should be kept clean to prevent any spillage of gastrointestinal contents into the perforation by aspirating liquids and, if necessary, changing the patient position to bring the perforation into a non-dependent location while minimizing insufflation of carbon dioxide to avoid compartment syndrome. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Use of carbon dioxide for insufflation is encouraged for all endoscopic procedures, especially any endoscopic procedure with increased risk of perforation. If available, carbon dioxide should be used for all endoscopic procedures. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All endoscopists should be aware of the procedures that carry an increased risk for perforation such as any dilation, foreign body removal, any per oral endoscopic myotomy (Zenker's, esophageal, pyloric), stricture incision, thermal coagulation for hemostasis or tumor ablation, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, ampullectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoluminal stenting with self-expanding metal stent (SEMS), full-thickness endoscopic resection, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in surgically altered anatomy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biliary and pancreatic access, EUS-guided cystogastrostomy, and endoscopic gastroenterostomy using a lumen apposing metal stent (LAMS). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Urgent surgical consultation should be highly considered in all cases with perforation even when endoscopic repair is technically successful. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: For all upper gastrointestinal perforations, the patient should be considered to be admitted for observation, receive intravenous fluids, be kept nothing by mouth, receive broad-spectrum antibiotics (to cover Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms), nasogastric tube (NGT) placement (albeit some exceptions), and surgical consultation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: For upper gastrointestinal tract perforations, a water-soluble upper gastrointestinal series should be considered to confirm the absence of continuing leak at the perforation site before initiating a clear liquid diet. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopic closure of esophageal perforations should be pursued when feasible, utilizing through-the-scope clips (TTSCs) or over-the-scope clips (OTSCs) for perforations <2 cm and endoscopic suturing for perforations >2 cm, reserving esophageal stenting with SEMS for cases where primary closure is not possible. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Endoscopic closure of gastric perforations should be pursued when feasible, utilizing TTSCs or OTSCs for perforations <2 cm and endoscopic suturing or combination of TTSCs and endoloop for perforations >2 cm. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: For large type 1 duodenal perforations (lateral duodenal wall tear >3 cm), being cognizant of the difficulty in closing them endoscopically, urgent surgical consultation should be made while the feasibility of endoscopic closure is assessed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Because type 2 periampullary (retroperitoneal) perforations are subtle and can be easily missed, the endoscopist should carefully assess the gas pattern on fluoroscopy to avoid delays in treatment and request a computed tomography scan if there is a concern for such a perforation; identified perforations of this type at the time of ERCP may be closed with TTSCs if feasible and/or by placing a fully covered SEMS into the bile duct across the ampulla. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: For the management of large duodenal polyps, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) should only be performed by experienced endoscopists and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) only by experts because both EMR and ESD in the duodenum require proficiency in resection and mucosal defect closure techniques to manage immediate and/or delayed perforations (caused by the proteolytic enzymes of the pancreas). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Endoscopists should be aware that colon perforations occurring during diagnostic colonoscopy are most commonly located in the sigmoid colon due to direct trauma from forceful advancement of the colonoscope. Such tears recognized at the time of colonoscopy may be closed by TTSCs or OTSCs if the bowel preparation is good and the patient is stable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Although colon perforation is responsive to various endoscopic tools such as TTSC, OTSC, and endoscopic suturing, perforations in the right colon, especially in the cecum, have been relegated to using only TTSCs because of inability to reach the site of the perforation with an endoscopic suturing device or OTSC if the colon is tortuous or unclean. Recently a new suture-based device for defect closure has been introduced allowing deep submucosal and intramuscular enhanced fixation through a standard gastroscope or colonoscope. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Patients with perforations who are hemodynamically unstable or who have suffered a delayed perforation with peritoneal signs or frank peritonitis should be surgically managed without any attempt at endoscopic closure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 16: In any adverse event including perforation, it is paramount to ensure accurate documentation, prompt discussion with the patient and family, and swift reporting to the quality officer (or equivalent) and risk management team of the institution (in major adverse events).",

      "abstract": "The increasing prescription of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists presents a peri-operative challenge for anaesthetists. These drugs delay gastric emptying, potentially increasing pulmonary aspiration risk. Despite recent recommendations from the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, Australian Society of Anaesthetists, and American Society of Anesthesiologists, there remain no formalised guidelines regarding preoperative optimisation for patients taking GLP-1 agonists. Given the current lack of evidence, we present a case series of incidents involving patients treated with GLP-1 agonists reported to webAIRS, a web-based anaesthetic incident reporting system in Australia and New Zealand. Among 11,700 reports from July 2009 to April 2024, 13 incidents related to GLP-1 agonist use were identified, including seven cases concerning aspiration. Patient factors potentially contributing to increased aspiration risks in these incidents included a higher body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, emergency case, and time from GLP-1 agonist cessation. Most incidents involved a rapid sequence induction for general anaesthesia with no cases utilising gastric ultrasound, preoperative nasogastric tube insertion, or intravenous erythromycin use. This case series highlights the potential concerns relating to GLP-1 treatment in the perioperative setting. Interdisciplinary collaboration and communication between anaesthetists, surgeons, general practitioners and endocrinologists are required to further investigate and establish preoperative guidelines for safe GLP-1 agonist use. Specifically, consideration in determining actual gastric contents of each patient despite generic fasting guidelines is needed. Early preoperative risk stratification should also improve patient safety and outcomes.",

Gastric duplication cysts (GDCs) are uncommon in adults, and most cases are discovered incidentally. Here, we report a fortuitous discovery of a rare case of an asymptomatic noncommunicating GDC in an adult revealed after an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of a suspected mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas. A 34-year-old female presented with renal colic. Her abdominal examination was normal. She presented a cystic image at the left lumbar discovered fortuitously during ultrasonography. On uro-computed tomography, there was a suspicion of a pancreatic cystadenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas suggested a mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreatic tail. The endoscopic ultrasound showed a cystic thick-walled formation in the tail of the pancreas. After guided fine-needle aspiration, a split aspect of the gastric wall appeared evoking a GDC. The cytology showed epithelial cells without mucin. Three years later, the patient does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. GDCs are a rare anomaly, and accurate diagnosis of these cysts is difficult. Surgical resection can offer a definitive diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is surgery to avoid the risk of malignancy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. A side effect of GLP1-RAs is delayed gastric emptying, which could increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration. This exploratory pilot study examines the use of ultrasound to identify high-risk patients taking GLP-1RAs before elective surgery. Methods A prospective study from July 2023 to February 2024 was conducted on patients who took their last weekly dose of semaglutide less than seven days before surgery. If preoperative gastric ultrasound revealed an empty stomach, surgery proceeded. Patients with residual gastric contents were rescheduled. Patient demographics, semaglutide dosage and timing, nil per os (NPO) time, and postoperative complications were reviewed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Twenty-five patients took their weekly semaglutide less than seven days before surgery. Twenty patients (80%) demonstrated empty stomachs on ultrasound and proceeded with surgery without complications. Gastric contents were found in five patients (20%), and surgery was rescheduled. Patients who took semaglutide one to three days before surgery were more likely to have residual gastric contents as compared to those who took semaglutide four to six days before surgery (p = 0.02). Discussion Gastric ultrasound is a useful tool that can prevent the cancellation of surgery for patients on semaglutide. Patients who took semaglutide within one to three days were more likely to have residual gastric contents compared to those who took it four to six days prior. Conclusion Preoperative gastric ultrasound can identify high-risk patients on semaglutide despite adequate NPO status.",

      "abstract": "Delayed gastric emptying increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration during anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery. Our aim in conducting this narrative review was to consider the effect of pregnancy on gastric emptying. The indices of gastric emptying after liquids, solids, or both and when fasted in the various trimesters of pregnancy, at the time of Caesarean delivery, in labour, and the postpartum period were assessed. We considered 32 observational studies, one nonrandomised controlled study, and 22 randomised controlled trials. The evidence indicates that, compared with the nonpregnant state, gastric emptying is decreased in the first but not the second and third trimesters. Before elective Caesarean delivery, carbohydrate drink or tea with milk leads to no difference in gastric cross-sectional area at 2 h relative to fasting or water. Following a standard fast for elective Caesarean delivery, patients may still have high-risk gastric contents. Compared with the nonpregnant state and third trimester, gastric emptying is delayed in labour, although the choice of analgesia has modifying effects. Systemic opioids delay gastric emptying. Epidural analgesia increases gastric emptying, but not back to baseline. Intrathecal analgesia delays gastric emptying relative to epidural analgesia. Women in labour who have eaten solids in the last 8 h still have high-risk gastric contents present in the stomach. The evidence with respect to the postpartum period is conflicting. In conclusion, inconsistencies in the literature reflect the unpredictability of gastric emptying in pregnancy and underline the potential value of gastric ultrasound in women who are pregnant.",

This study aimed to evaluate the proportion of such children with high-risk gastric contents using preoperative gastric ultrasound. Prospective observational cohort study. Specialist pediatric center over a 30-month period. Children undergoing surgery within 24 h of an acute extremity fracture. None. According to preoperative qualitative and quantitative ultrasound analysis of the antrum in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions, gastric contents were classified as high-risk (clear liquid with calculated gastric fluid volume > 0.8 mL.kg Forty-one children (37%; 95% CI: 28-47) of the 110 studied (mean(SD) age: 10(3) years) presented with high-risk gastric contents, including 26 (24%; 95% CI: 16-33) with solids/thick liquid contents. Scanning in the supine position alone allowed a diagnosis of high-risk gastric contents in 23 children out of the 63 for whom right lateral decubitus positioning was unfeasible. Gastric contents remained undetermined in 41 children, including one with a non-contributory gastric US (antrum non-visualized). Proximal limb fractures (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.0-6.2), preoperative administration of opioids (OR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.1-13), and the absence of bowel sounds (OR: 8.0; 95% CI: 1.4-44) were associated with high-risk gastric contents. Performing surgery the day following the trauma was a protective factor (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.6). No cases of pulmonary aspiration occurred. At least one-third of children with an acute isolated extremity fracture had preoperative gastric contents identified as high risk for pulmonary aspiration. Although preoperative history can guide anesthetic strategy in this population, ultrasound allowed clear stratification of the risk of aspiration in most cases.",

      "abstract": "Interpretation of gastric ultrasound relies on the use of a clinical algorithm that combines qualitative analysis of the gastric antrum contents with the calculation of the volume of fluid contents. This reference method may be difficult to apply in the parturient. We therefore aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a simple qualitative assessment in the supine position for the diagnosis of high-risk gastric contents in the parturient. We also assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a composite scale and another clinical algorithm based on a mathematical model different to that used in the reference method. Prospective observational cohort study. University hospital, Lyon, France. Adult women admitted to the delivery room. Qualitative and quantitative gastric ultrasound examination within the first hour following admission. With respect to the reference method, the diagnostic accuracy of a simple qualitative assessment for the diagnosis of high-risk gastric contents was assessed. The diagnostic accuracy of a composite scale and another clinical algorithm, and the agreement between each approach were also assessed. A total of 235 parturients were included and analyzed. The simple qualitative assessment led to conclusive ultrasound assessment in 233 (99%) women, while the reference method led to conclusive assessment in 213 (91%) women (P < 0.05). The sensitivity and the specificity of the simple qualitative assessment were 97% (95%CI: 93 to 99%) and 96% (95%CI: 90 to 99%), respectively. These were not significantly different from those of the composite scale and the clinical algorithm. The four approaches showed almost perfect agreement with each other. These results suggest that simple qualitative assessment may be useful in clinical practice to help the anesthesiologist in the assessment of gastric contents status and risk of aspiration.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration of gastric contents during induction of general anesthesia remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in anesthesia. Recent data show that pulmonary aspiration still accounts for many cases with implications on mortality despite technical and technological evolution. Practical, ethical, and methodological issues prevent high-quality research in the setting of aspiration and rapid sequence induction/intubation, and significant controversy is ongoing. Patients' position, drugs choice, dosing and timing, use of cricoid force, and a reliable risk assessment are widely debated with significant questions still unanswered. We focus our discussion on three approaches to promote a better understanding of rapid sequence induction/intubation and airway management decision-making. Firstly, we review how we can use qualitative and quantitative assessment of fasting status and gastric content with the point-of-care ultrasound as an integral part of preoperative evaluation and planning. Secondly, we propose using imaging-based mathematical models to study different patient positions and aspiration mechanisms, including identifying aspiration triggers. Thirdly, we promote the development of a global data collection system aiming to obtain precise epidemiological data. Therefore, we fill the gap between evidence-based medicine and experts' opinion through easily accessible and diffused computer-based databases. A better understanding of aspiration epidemiology obtained through focused global data gathering systems, the widespread use of ultrasound-based prandial status evaluation, and development of advanced mathematical models might potentially guide safer airway management decision making in the 21",

Introduction of point-of-care ultrasound as a tool for anesthetists kindled interest in its use for GRV estimation. In this prospective observational study, we recruited 57 critically ill patients and analyzed 586 samples of GRV obtained by both ultrasonography (USG) and manual aspiration. The analysis showed that USG-guided GRV was significantly correlated (r=0.788, P<0.001) and in positive agreement with manual aspiration based on Bland-Altman plot, with a mean difference of 8.50±14.84 (95% confidence interval, 7.389-9.798). The upper and lower limits of agreement were 37.7 and -20.5, respectively, within the ±1.96 standard deviation (P<0.001). The respective sensitivity and positive predictive value, specificity and negative predictive value, and area under the curve of USG for feeding intolerance were 66.67%, 98.15%, and 0.82%, with 96.49% diagnostic accuracy. Ultrasonographic estimation of GRV was positively, significantly correlated and in agreement with the manual aspiration method and estimated feeding intolerance earlier. Routine use of gastric USG could avoid clinical situations where feeding status is unclear and there is high risk of aspiration and could become a standard practice of critical care.",

      "abstract": "Main-duct (MD-) and mixed-type (MT-) IPMNs harbor an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and warrant surgical resection. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) are important in the diagnosis of IPMNs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether endoscopic procedures manipulating the MD impact postoperative adverse events in patients with MD- and MT-IPMNs. We performed a retrospective study of 369 patients who underwent resections for MD- or MT-IPMN at two tertiary centers (2000-2019). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for postoperative adverse events to compare the risks between intervention (ERCP, EUS-FNA with branch duct (BD) aspirated, EUS-FNA with MD aspirated from the duct directly or cyst/mass arising from MD) versus no-intervention group. 33.1 % of patients had a preoperative ERCP and 69.4 % had EUS-FNA. Postoperative adverse events included: 30-day readmission (12.7 %), delayed gastric emptying (13.8 %), pancreatic fistula (10.3 %), abdominal abscess (5.7 %), cardiopulmonary adverse events (11.4 %), and mortality (1.4 %). The model was adjusted for potential confounders. There were no significant differences between the ERCP and no-ERCP groups for specific adverse events. Compared to no-EUS-FNA groups, groups of EUS-FNA with BD aspiration and EUS-FNA with MD aspiration from the main pancreatic duct directly or cyst/mass arising from MD did not show a significant increase in specific adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were not significantly increased among patients who had ERCP or EUS-FNA before surgical resection for MD- or MT-IPMNs. Endoscopic procedures directly sampling the MD can be safely pursued for diagnostic purposes in selected cases.",

Follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed submucosal tumor, which was suspected as a swollen lymph node by CT and endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration revealed the recurrence of gastric cancer. We performed total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathological examination revealed no local recurrent tumor at the ESD site in the stomach. Swollen lymph node was diagnosed as metastasis and lymph node metastasis was limited near the cardia.

Given the increased aspiration risk in pregnant patients due to physiological changes, GDM-related gastric motility alterations may further complicate anesthetic management. A prospective observational cohort study included 60 pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery: 30 diagnosed with GDM and 30 without GDM. Gastric ultrasonography was performed in both the supine and right lateral decubitus positions to assess antral cross-sectional area (CSA), gastric volume, and content classification (Grade 0, 1, or 2). Quantitative measurements, fasting durations, demographic information, and preoperative blood glucose levels were collected and statistically analyzed. No significant differences were observed in gastric volumes between the GDM group (86.14 ± 38.43 ml) and the control group (77.89 ± 44.54 ml;  Gastric ultrasonography is a valuable, noninvasive method for evaluating gastric content and volume in pregnant women, particularly those with GDM. The higher prevalence of residual gastric content in GDM patients indicates a potential delay in gastric emptying, which could increase perioperative aspiration risk despite adherence to standard fasting protocols. These findings highlight the need for individualized anesthetic strategies, particularly in emergency and high-risk obstetric anesthesia settings.",

This prospective observational study included 80 patients divided into two groups of 40 diabetic patients with a minimum of 8 years history of diabetes and 40 nondiabetic patients aged >18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status I-II kept with similar fasting intervals. Before induction of general anesthesia, gastric ultrasound was performed using standard gastric scanning protocol to measure craniocaudal (CC) and anteroposterior (AP) diameters followed by calculation of antral cross-sectional area (CSA) and gastric volume in semi-sitting (SS) and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position using curved array probe. The gastric antrum volume (GV) was classified as Grade 0, 1, or 2, and risk stratification for aspiration was done. The nasogastric tube was inserted after induction of anesthesia to aspirate and compare the gastric content. In the semi-sitting position, the mean CC and AP diameters were 16.38 ± 3.31 mm and 10.1 ± 2.53 mm in the non-diabetic group and 25.19 ± 4.08 mm and 15.8 ± 3.51 mm in the diabetic group, respectively.

      "abstract": "A period of fasting before tracheal extubation of ventilated patients in the ICU is common practice, aiming to reduce gastric volume and aspiration risk. As the volume of gastric content is unknown at the time of extubation, the efficacy of this practice is uncertain. A prospective, observational study using gastric ultrasound was undertaken. Images were obtained at four time points: (i) at baseline, with gastric feeds running; (ii) after suctioning of gastric contents through a gastric tube; (iii) after a 4 h period with no gastric feed running; and (iv) after both a 4 h fasting period and gastric tube suctioning. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients classed as low risk of aspiration with each intervention, using qualitative and quantitative gastric ultrasound. Fifty-four patients in the ICU were enrolled. Forty-four (81%) subjects had images that were suitable for analysis. Suctioning of stomach content through a gastric tube and fasting were equivalent with 39/44 (88.6%) and 5/44 (11.4%) subjects classified as low risk and at risk of aspiration, respectively. A period of fasting followed by suction resulted in 41/44 (93.2%) patients being at low risk. Suctioning of stomach contents through the gastric tube and a 4 h fasting period appear equivalent at reducing gastric volume below a safe threshold. A small percentage did not reach the threshold despite all interventions.",

      "abstract": "Cumulative energy/protein deficit is associated with impaired outcomes in pediatric intensive care Units (PICU). Enteral nutrition is the preferred mode, but its delivery may be compromised by periods of feeding interruptions around procedures, with peri-extubation fasting the most common procedure. Currently, there is no evidence to guide the duration of the peri-extubation fasting in PICU. Therefore, we aimed to explore current PICU fasting practices around the time of extubation and the rationales supporting them. A cross sectional electronic survey was disseminated  We received responses from 122 PICUs internationally, mostly from Europe. The survey confirmed that fasting practices are often extrapolated from guidelines for fasting prior to elective anesthesia. However, there were striking differences in the duration of fasting times, with some units not fasting at all (in patients considered to be low risk), while others withheld feeding for all patients. Fasting following extubation also showed large variations in practice: 46 (38%) and 26 (21%) of PICUs withheld oral and gastric/jejunal nutrition more than 5 h, respectively, and 45 (37%) started oral feeding based on child demand. The risk of vomiting/aspiration and reducing nutritional deficit were the main reasons for fasting children [78 (64%)] or reducing fasting times [57 (47%)] respectively. This variability in practices suggests that shorter fasting times might be safe. Shortening the duration of unnecessary fasting, as well as accelerating the extubation process could potentially be achieved by using other methods of assessing gastric emptiness, such as gastric point of care ultrasonography (POCUS). Yet only half of the units were aware of this technique, and very few used it.",

In study 1, although no tumor cells were observed in gastric juice in MIAB before the procedure, they were observed in 64% of patients after obtaining samples (P < 0.001). In contrast, no tumor cells were observed in the gastric juice in EUS-FNAB before and after the procedure. In study 2, there was no significant difference in 5-year disease-free survival between MIAB (100%) and EUS-FNAB (97.1%) (P = 0.27).

We hypothesized, that an inserted gastric tube increases the risk of gastric insufflation. Single center, prospective, randomized-controlled cross-over trial. Tertiary academic hospital in Germany. 152 patients, ASA I-III, scheduled for general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway. Gastric insufflation was investigated during an incremental pressure trial up to a maximum airway pressure of 30 cmH Gastric insufflation was detected with real-time ultrasound. Frequency of gastric insufflation was higher with than without inserted gastric tube during the incremental pressure trial (10.9 % (16/147) vs. 2.7 % (4/147), p = 0.009) and during oropharyngeal leak pressure measurement (16.3 % (24/147) vs. 5.4 % (8/147), p = 0.004).

Herein, we report the case of an 83 year-old man who presented with a solid mass in the pancreatic tail, measuring 35 mm in diameter, with cystic degeneration. EUS-TA was performed using a 22-gauge biopsy needle, with a single puncture via the stomach; however, no definitive pathological diagnosis was achieved. Due to the strong suspicion of malignancy, surgery was performed at the patient's request, and the postoperative pathological diagnosis was pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma. One year after surgery, computed tomography revealed a string of bead-like nodules within the gastric wall. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed three submucosal, tumor-like raised lesions aligned in a row on the upper posterior wall of the gastric body. EUS detected a solid mass with cystic degeneration. Histological findings from EUS-TA specimens were consistent with those from the pancreatic resection specimen, leading to a diagnosis of NTS. Although reports of NTS have been increasing in recent years, cases of NTS occurring after only a single puncture remain extremely rare. This case clearly demonstrates that NTS can occur even after a single puncture, highlighting the importance of obtaining thorough informed consent regarding this risk prior to performing EUS-TA.",

The study was conducted as an observational study. Sixty-five patients scheduled for elective surgery, aged 18-86 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores II-III, and who have diabetes were included after local ethics committee approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Demographic data of cases were recorded. Patients whose gastric residual volume (GRV) was calculated using the pupils equal, round, reactive to light, and accommodation (PERLA) formula following gastric antrum measurement in the right lateral decubitus and supine position by ultrasound were categorized as low or high risk for aspiration. Thirty-one patients were in the low-risk group, and 34 patients were in the high-risk group. Sex, weight, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, and duration of diabetes were not statistically significant (p > 0.5). Age (p = 0.006) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.005) were statistically significant. The risk of aspiration decreases with age. Hyperglycemia is related to delayed gastric emptying and a high risk for aspiration. The duration of fasting, GRV, and cross-sectional area (CSA) were statistically significant (p = 0.017, p = 0.000, and p = 0.000, respectively). Gastric emptying might be delayed in diabetic patients resulting in a high risk for aspiration pneumonia. The risk of aspiration increases in young diabetic patients, and preoperative FBG measurements can provide an idea about gastric emptying in diabetic patients. Gastric ultrasound (USG) may contribute to guidelines for determining more appropriate fasting times for other patient populations, such as obese, pregnant, or child patients.",

      "abstract": "The aspiration of gastric residual volume through the gastric tube increases the risk of feed interruption episodes, prolongs the time needed to achieve full enteral feeding and regain birth weight, and may potentially damage the gastric mucous. This study aimed to develop a point-of-care ultrasound-based model to calculate gastric residual volume in preterm infants. This observational study enrolled 100 preterm infants who fed by gastric tube. The collected data included general characteristics of the preterm infants, the antral cross-sectional area in the right lateral position within 30 min prior to feeding and the gastric residue volume measured through gastric tube. A linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the antral cross-sectional area and the aspirated gastric residual volume, with the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. A stepwise linear multiple regression was employed to model the relationship between the suctioned residual volume and the parameters under consideration. Subsequently, we utilized the Bland-Altman plot to assess the agreement between the gastric residual volume measured by aspiration and our model, respectively. Overall, 89 preterm infants were included in the final analysis. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between the gastric antral cross-sectional area in the right lateral decubitus position and the suctioned volume (P < 0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.905). We developed an ultrasound calculation model as follows: Volume (ml)= -3.74 + 9.08 × Gastric Antral Cross-Sectional Area (measured in the right lateral decubitus position) (cm2). When comparing the ultrasound calculated volume and suctioned volume, the mean was 0.05 ml kg-1 and the limit of consistency was - 1.59 to 1.69 ml kg-1 between the ultrasound calculated volume and suctioned one. The use of ultrasound to assess gastric residual volume (GRV) offers a promising alternative to gastric tube suction, potentially reducing associated complications and enhancing enteral nutrition management in preterm infants. Our study represents a pioneering effort in the development of a point-of-care ultrasound-based calculation model for non-invasive GRV assessment in this vulnerable population.",

The measured values of the GRV were analyzed in relation to the clinical course, the nutrition, and other parameters. Measurements could be performed without interrupting the flow of clinical care and without pausing EN. The GRV was significantly larger with sparsely auscultated bowel sounds than with normal and excited bowel sounds ( The GRV measured by miniaturized ultrasound devices can provide important information about ICU patients without restricting treatment procedures in the ICU.

To assess the association between GLP-1 RA use and prevalence of increased residual gastric content (RGC), a major risk factor for aspiration under anesthesia, using gastric ultrasonography. This cross-sectional study prospectively enrolled patients from a large, tertiary, university-affiliated hospital from June 6 through July 12, 2023. Participants followed preprocedural fasting guidelines before an elective procedure under anesthesia. Patients with altered gastric anatomy (eg, from previous gastric surgery), pregnancy, recent trauma (<1 month), or an inability to lie in the right lateral decubitus position for gastric ultrasonography were excluded. Use of a once-weekly GLP-1 RA. The primary outcome was the presence of increased RGC, defined by the presence of solids, thick liquids, or more than 1.5 mL/kg of clear liquids on gastric ultrasonography. Analysis was adjusted for confounders using augmented inverse probability of treatment weighting, a propensity score-based technique. Secondarily, the association between the duration of drug interruption and the prevalence of increased RGC was explored. Among the 124 participants (median age, 56 years [IQR, 46-65 years]; 75 [60%] female), the prevalence of increased RGC was 56% (35 of 62) in patients with GLP-1 RA use (exposure group) compared with 19% (12 of 62) in patients who were not taking a GLP-1 RA drug (control group). After adjustment for confounding, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a 30.5% (95% CI, 9.9%-51.2%) higher prevalence of increased RGC (adjusted prevalence ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.23-4.97). There was no association between the duration of GLP-1 RA interruption and the prevalence of increased RGC (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65-1.14). Use of a GLP-1 RA was independently associated with increased RGC on preprocedural gastric ultrasonography. The findings suggest that the preprocedural fasting duration suggested by current guidelines may be inadequate in this group of patients at increased risk of aspiration under anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "Induction of anesthesia for emergency procedures, without prior gastric preparation and incomplete fasting, is associated with the risk of reflux of stomach contents and aspiration. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) metoclopramide administration on gastric emptying in opium users, candidate for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA). In the present case-control study, opium-dependent (case) and non-dependent (control) patients in need of PSA were administered with 10 mg IV metoclopramide after undergoing gastric ultrasonography for determination of its area and contents. Then, 30 minutes after the administration of metoclopramide, the area and contents of the stomach were measured again and compared with the measures obtained before the intervention. 135 patients were evaluated in three groups of 45, including the case, control, and placebo groups. The three groups were similar regarding mean age (p = 0.068), sex (p = 0.067), weight (p = 0.596), height (p = 0.671), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.877), duration of fasting (p = 0.596), and type of gastric contents (p = 0.124). Mean antral cross-sectional area (CSA) of the study participants in the case, control, and placebo groups before the administration of the drug was 8.49 ± 1.40, 8.31 ± 2.56, and 6.56 ± 1.72 cm It seems that metoclopramide administration in opium users in need of PSA leads to a significant decrease in mean gastric area and increases gastric emptying.",

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also lead to satiety and appetite reduction through action on the brain's appetite regulation centers, leading to weight loss in obese patients. However, because glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists work to slow gastric emptying, a safety concern has been raised in patients undergoing deep sedation or general anesthesia regarding gastric aspiration, and considering their long half-life in the blood, they are difficult to manage in the perioperative period. The purpose of this review is (i) to explore the present knowledge about the risk of aspiration before anesthesia; (ii) to describe the method for evaluating the presence of liquid and food in the stomach before surgery; and (iii) to balance the actual warning with the opportunity for future discovery about their benefits.",

Ingestion of carbohydrate solutions up until two hours before elective surgery has shown positive results. The authors present a case of regurgitation in a patient with apparently low risk for delayed gastric emptying who drank a carbohydrate solution two hours before induction of anaesthesia. An 80-year-old male patient with a relevant history of ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stage 3 chronic kidney disease and hypertension, was diagnosed with rectal cancer. He was scheduled for an anterior rectal resection hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery under the ERAS program, which included a 200 mL carbohydrate drink the night before and in the morning of the surgery, no less than two hours before the induction of anaesthesia. Immediately after loss of consciousness, there was regurgitation of a significant amount of clear fluid. Even though ingestion of oral carbohydrate drinks is considered to be safe up to two hours before anaesthesia, further evaluation (e.g., gastric ultrasonography) may be considered in non-high-risk patients.",

      "title": "Assessing Full Stomach Prevalence with Ultrasound Following Preoperative Fasting in Diabetic Patients with Dysautonomia: A Comparative Observational Study.",
      "abstract": "Traditionally, diabetics have been considered patients with a high risk of aspiration due to having delayed gastric emptying; However, the evidence concerning residual gastric volume (GV) in fasting diabetic patients is inconsistent. This study aimed to compare the fasting GV of diabetic patients with or without dysautonomia with control patients scheduled for elective surgery using gastric ultrasound. This bicentric prospective single-blinded case-control study was conducted at 2 university hospitals in Spain. Patients aged over 18 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical statuses I to III and having similar fasting statuses, were included in the study. The primary outcome was to compare the prevalence of risk stomach using the Perlas gastric content grading scale evaluated by ultrasound in the 3 groups. Secondary outcomes included the measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) and GV in the right lateral decubitus (RLD) position, as well as the prevalence of solid gastric residue. A total of 289 patients were recruited for the study, comprising 145 diabetic patients (83 of whom had dysautonomia) and 144 patients in the control group. The percentage of patients classified as Perlas grade 2 was 13.2% in the control group, 16.1% in diabetic patients without dysautonomia, and 22.9% in diabetic patients with dysautonomia ( P = .31). Antral CSA was significantly higher in diabetic patients with dysautonomia (6.5 [4.8-8.4]) compared to the control group (5.4 [4.0-7.2]; P = .04). However, no significant differences were observed between groups in residual GV. Among diabetic patients with dysautonomia, 12% exhibited solid gastric residue, which was twice the percentage observed in diabetic patients without dysautonomia (4.8%) and 3 times higher than that in the control group (3.5%; P = .03). The presence of dysautonomia was associated with an increased odds ratio of solid gastric residue (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-8.87; P = .01) after adjusting for confounding factors. This study offers insights into the relationship between dysautonomia in patients with diabetes mellitus and the presence of full stomach, underscoring the significance of preoperative gastric ultrasound evaluation in managing perioperative risks in this population.",

RSI may fail if an unexpected difficulty intubation occurred and then a mask ventilation had to be applied. The worst scenario is that mask ventilation also failed, severe hypoxia developed followed by cardiac arrest. A 14-year-old child with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed with intestinal obstruction scheduled for emergency surgery. Due to high risk of aspiration, rapid sequence induction was applied. Although the preoperative airway assessment was normal, unexpectedly difficult airway was encountered. There was a failure of vocal cord exposure under video laryngoscope. A crisis happened when mask ventilation failed. Facing the disaster of \"cannot intubate, cannot ventilate\" and following severe hypoxia and cardiac arrest, the anesthesiologist established a surgical airway which successfully resuscitated the patient. A rare disease of laryngeal tuberculosis might be the underlying cause. Patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis should be carefully evaluated for the presence of laryngeal tuberculosis, with laryngeal imaging as an optional diagnostic component. When encountering unexpected difficult airways during rapid sequence intubation leading to hypoxic cardiac arrest, immediate surgical airway intervention is critical for patient survival.",

      "title": "Cutaneous and visceral phaeohyphomycosis in an immunocompetent golden retriever.",
      "abstract": "A 3-year-old castrated male golden retriever was presented for evaluation of 2 cutaneous masses along the abdominal midline and a 6-month history of progressive lethargy and inappetence. Two years earlier, the dog underwent a gastrotomy to retrieve a foreign object and recovered uneventfully. Fluid aspirated from the lesions was culture-negative for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial growth. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a large intra-abdominal mass with apparent communication with the cutaneous lesion, along with gossypiboma from the previous laparotomy. Neoplasia or a sterile abscess were suspected. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and revealed that the intra-abdominal mass was adhered to the abdominal midline and the greater curvature of the stomach. The masses and affected portions of the body wall and stomach were resected and histopathology was consistent with phaeohyphomycosis. Antifungal therapy with voriconazole (6.3 mg/kg, PO, q12h) was initiated. At 1 mo after surgery, all clinical signs had resolved. At 4 and 7 mo after surgery, the dog continued to thrive despite 2 small masses, seen on abdominal ultrasound imaging on the intra-abdominal midline, suggestive of reoccurrence. Continued voriconazole therapy was administered in lieu of further surgical excision. One year after surgery, the masses were no longer present on ultrasonographic evaluation. Phaeohyphomycosis is a rare, opportunistic fungal infection that typically affects the dermis and subcutis of immunocompromised dogs. This is the first report of phaeohyphomycosis in an immunocompetent dog and involving the dermis, subcutis, and abdominal viscera. Key clinical message: This case adds to the very limited literature on phaeohyphomycosis in dogs and illustrates that surgery could be a risk factor for infection, even in dogs with no known underlying disease or immunodeficiency. Phéohyphomycose cutanée et viscérale chez un golden retriever immunocompétentUn golden retriever mâle castré de 3 ans a été présenté pour évaluation de 2 masses cutanées le long de la ligne médiane abdominale et d’un historique de léthargie et d’inappétence progressive depuis 6 mois. Deux ans plus tôt, le chien avait subi une gastrotomie pour récupérer un objet étranger et s’était rétabli sans incident. Le liquide aspiré des lésions était négatif en culture pour la croissance bactérienne aérobie et anaérobie. L’échographie abdominale a mis en évidence une masse intra-abdominale importante avec une communication apparente avec la lésion cutanée, ainsi qu’un gossyibome issu de la laparotomie précédente. Un néoplasme ou un abcès stérile ont été suspectés. Une laparotomie exploratoire a été réalisée et a révélé que la masse intra-abdominale adhérait à la ligne médiane abdominale et à la grande courbure de l’estomac. La masse et les parties affectées de la paroi corporelle et de l’estomac ont été réséquées et l’histopathologie était compatible avec une phaeohyphomycose. Un traitement antifongique par voriconazole (6,3 mg/kg, PO, toutes les 12 heures) a été instauré. Un mois après l’intervention chirurgicale, tous les signes cliniques avaient disparu. À 4 et 7 mois après l’intervention chirurgicale, le chien a continué à bien allé malgré 2 petites masses, observées à l’échographie abdominale sur la ligne médiane intra-abdominale, évocatrices d’une réapparition. La poursuite du traitement par le voriconazole a été administrée au lieu d’une nouvelle excision chirurgicale. Un an après l’intervention chirurgicale, les masses n’étaient plus présentes à l’évaluation échographique. La phaeohyphomycose est une infection fongique rare et opportuniste qui affecte généralement le derme et le sous-cutané des chiens immunodéprimés. Il s’agit du premier rapport de phaeohyphomycose chez un chien immunocompétent et impliquant le derme, le tissu sous-cutané et les viscères abdominaux.Message clinique clé :Ce cas s’ajoute à la littérature très limitée sur la phaeohyphomycose chez le chien et illustre que la chirurgie pourrait être un facteur de risque d’infection, même chez les chiens sans maladie sous-jacente ou immunodéficience connue.(Traduit par D",

      "abstract": "Perioperative pulmonary aspiration is a critical complication linked to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk populations such as patients with diabetes, obesity, gastroparesis, or those using Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Standard fasting protocols may not be appropriate for these patients, as they have increased propensity of delayed gastric emptying, hence increasing the complex of the preoperative risk assessment. Gastric ultrasound (GUS) provides a non-invasive, reliable method for assessing gastric content and volume, enabling anaesthesia professionals to make informed decisions regarding aspiration risk, airway management, and surgical scheduling. By identifying patients with elevated gastric volumes, GUS has the potential to reduce aspiration-related complications and unnecessary surgical cancellations.Despite its clear clinical benefits, the adoption of GUS in anaesthetic practice remains limited, primarily due to the technical skill required for accurate quantitative assessments. Qualitative evaluations of gastric contents are simpler for beginners, but precise volume measurements, essential for risk stratification, demand more extensive training. Recent studies demonstrate that with structured training, even novice operators can achieve high diagnostic accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) can further enhance GUS utility by automating volume calculations, guiding probe placement, and providing real-time feedback. These capabilities could significantly shorten the learning curve and improve consistency in risk assessment.Incorporating GUS and AI tools into anaesthesia training can overcome adoption barriers, enabling clinicians to more accurately assess aspiration risk and enhance patient safety in perioperative care.",

      "abstract": "Failure to adhere to perioperative fasting requirements increases aspiration risk and can lead to delay or cancellation of surgery. Point of care gastric ultrasound may guide decision-making to delay, cancel or proceed with surgery. This study aimed to describe gastric contents using point of care gastric ultrasound in pediatric patients with known fasting guideline violations presenting for elective surgery. This was a single-center retrospectivechart review of gastric ultrasound scans in patients presenting for elective surgeries with \"nothing by mouth\" violation (per fasting guidelines) or unclear fasting status. The primary outcome is description of gastric contents using point of care ultrasound. The ultrasound findings were classified as low-risk for aspiration (empty, clear fluid < 1.5 ml/kg), high-risk (solids, clear fluid > 1.5 ml/kg), or inconclusive study. Gastric ultrasound findings were communicated to the attending anesthesiologist. For patients proceeding without delay the estimated time saved was defined as the difference between ultrasound scan time and presumed case start time based on American Society of Anesthesiologists fasting guidelines. We identified 106 patients with a median age of 4.8 years. There were 31 patients (29.2%) that had ultrasound finding of high-risk gastric contents. These patients had cases that were delayed, cancelled or proceeded with rapid sequence intubation. Sixty-six patients (62.3%) were determined to be low-risk gastric contents and proceeded with surgery without delay. For these patients, a median of 2.6 h was saved. No aspiration events were recorded for any patients. It is feasible to use preoperative point of care gastric ultrasound to determine stomach contents and risk-stratify pediatric patients presenting for elective surgical procedures with fasting non-adherence. Preoperative gastric ultrasound may have a role in determining changes in anesthetic management in this patient population.",

According to the random number table method, patients were divided into GRV guided enteral nutrition by traditional gastric juice pumpback method (control group, 22 patients) and GRV guided enteral nutrition by bedside ultrasound (test group, 20 patients). General data were collected from both groups, and clinical indicators such as hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), neutrophil percentage (Neut%), procalcitonin (PCT), absolute lymphocytes (LYM), prealbumin (PA), and retinol-binding protein (RBP) were dynamically observed. Inflammation, infection, immunity, nutritional indicators, and the incidence of reflux/aspiration, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were compared between the two groups, and further compared the proportion of patients with respectively to reach the target energy 25%, 50%, and 70% on days 1, 3, and 5 of initiated enteral nutrition.

We present a case of a 71-year-old male who was brought to the hospital after having a cardiac arrest. Following stabilisation and receiving an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he required NGT for feeding purposes. A few days later, abdominal distension was noted, and chest imaging was requested mainly for worsening respiratory parameters. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed gastric perforation and a misplaced NGT. Being a high-risk patient and in the absence of peritonism and frank sepsis, conservative management was adopted and included proton pump inhibitors (PPI), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), stomach aspiration via a Ryle tube and consideration of imaging-guided drainage. No risk factor for gastric perforation was identified in this presented case. The stable course of follow-up suggested sealed perforation; however, he died due to an extensive intracardiac thrombus. Though this incidence did not contribute directly to the patient's death, it definitely added to the overall morbidity and negatively influenced the management of the other medical conditions. For complement, we also report a review of the ten similar cases in the literature, highlighting the associated risk factors, relevant clinical challenges, lines of management executed. The main aim of this case report is to enhance doctors' awareness of this serious complication, especially in patients with risk factors, and its diagnostic dilemmas. Early recognition and prompt intervention are recommended for a better outcome.",

      "abstract": "Airway management for nonelective surgical procedures in the setting of trauma, pain, and opioid use can be complicated by the potential for aspiration due to delayed gastric emptying. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) remains a useful tool for evaluating gastric content and volume in various clinical settings. The authors evaluated gastric volume and content in children scheduled for urgent and semi-urgent procedures to assess their aspiration risk. After obtaining consent, gastric POCUS was performed in the preoperative holding area for pediatric patients scheduled for both elective and nonelective surgery. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of the gastric antrum were taken, and the risk of gastric aspiration was calculated. Additional data collected included patient demographics, the type of surgery,  The study cohort included 100 patients ranging in age from 3 to 17 years old (mean age 9.2 years). Out of these 100 patients, gastric scanning was successfully conducted in 98 patients. Sixteen of fifty-nine nonelective patients (27%) had received opioids for pain control prior to surgery. Among the 34 patients who had suffered an acute injury, 7 (21%) had been NPO for <8 hours at the time of the injury. Ninety-nine out of hundred patients had been NPO for at least 6 hours at the time of the gastric ultrasound. Based on our gastric ultrasound findings, all patients who were appropriately NPO had either Grade 0 or Grade 1 risk for aspiration, indicating a low risk of aspiration. The preliminary data show that when patients presenting for nonelective surgery are appropriately NPO, they may have a low risk of aspiration. This information may help guide the choice of anesthetic induction technique, particularly when concerns exist about the safety of a rapid sequence induction. It allows for a more stable and controlled induction of anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive cancer with extremely poor therapeutic outcomes due to its high metastatic potential and a significant risk of recurrence after radical resection. Liver is the most common metastatic target organ of esophageal carcinoma, followed by the lungs, bones, and brain. Few cases of solitary pancreatic and hepatic metastases of esophageal carcinoma have been reported. We report the case of a 67-year-old male presenting with pancreatic and hepatic lesions. In addition, a friable lesion with an irregular nodular surface in the distal esophagus was detected by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Pathohistological examination confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The pancreatic lesion was also biopsied via ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, which also revealed squamous cell carcinoma. The hepatic lesion was also identified as metastatic carcinoma by magnetic resonance imaging, most likely of the same origin. Due to comorbidities that precluded surgery, the patient was administered adjuvant therapy and a multidisciplinary decision was made for palliative care. The patient died 1 month later due to multiorgan failure caused by hemorrhage from a peptic ulcer. To our knowledge, this is only the sixth case of pancreatic metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This case report suggests to clinicians the importance of considering potential comorbidities in every patient with advanced cancer, such as gastric ulcer and cachexia.",

      "abstract": "Oesophagectomy is an established treatment option for the management of oesophageal carcinoma. This procedure results in loss of the lower oesophageal sphincter, which increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration in patients presenting for subsequent surgeries. Consequently, innovative strategies are needed to enhance safety during airway management. Although Sellick manoeuvre (cricoid pressure) is commonly used to mitigate the risk of aspiration, there is limited evidence to support its efficacy. Additionally, cricoid pressure may not be effective in patients who have undergone oesophagectomy because of the altered neck anatomy. In this case series, we present seven post-oesophagectomy patients who underwent ultrasound-guided modified Sellick manoeuvre for airway management. During tracheal intubation with a videolaryngoscope, the gastric conduit in the neck was visualised and compressed with the ultrasound probe, attempting to oppose both walls of the conduit and reduce the risk of regurgitation. This approach addresses the challenges posed by altered anatomy and the limitations of traditional cricoid pressure, potentially enhancing the safety of airway management in these patients. While ultrasound-guided oesophageal compression shows promise as a feasible technique, further studies are needed to validate its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) of the gastric antrum can predict the adequacy of fasting before surgery and anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of gastric POCUS in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy procedures. We performed a single-center cohort study in patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy. Consenting patient's gastric antrum was scanned before anesthetic care for endoscopy to determine the cross-sectional area (CSA) and qualitatively determine safe and unsafe contents. Further, an estimate of residual gastric volume was determined using the formula and the nomogram methods. Subsequently, gastric secretions aspirated during endoscopy were quantified and further correlated with nomogram and formula-based assessments. No patient required a change in the primary anesthetic plan except for using rapid sequence induction in those with unsafe contents on POCUS scans. Qualitative ultrasound measurements consistently determined safe and unsafe gastric residual contents in 83 patients enrolled in the study. Unsafe contents were determined by qualitative scans in 4 out of 83 cases (5%) despite adequate fasting status. Quantitatively, only a moderate correlation was demonstrated between measured gastric volumes and nomogram (r = .40, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.57; P = .0002) or formula-based (r = .38, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.55; P = .0004) determinations of residual gastric volumes. In daily clinical practice, qualitative POCUS determination of residual gastric content is a feasible and useful technique to identify patients at risk of aspiration before upper GI endoscopy procedures.",

A preoperative fasting (nil per os; NPO) interval is widely used to reduce this risk, but this approach is based on assumptions about the prevalence of typical gastric emptying rates. We assessed NPO guidelines' reliability with ultrasound (US) imaging and suction in pediatric patients presenting for single long-bone fracture repair after appropriate NPO intervals, when nearly all should have had empty stomachs. This prospective cross-sectional observational study comprised 200 pediatric surgical patients. As their NPO times varied by food/drink type, we defined \"weighted NPO units\" as the lowest multiple of elapsed recommended NPO times between consumption and surgery for each type of food or drink. We used US to image the stomach and its contents before anesthesia induction, followed by gastric suction. We evaluated the relationships between weighted NPO units, US gastric contents grade, opioid analgesic dosage and timing, and suctioned volume. Despite meeting typical NPO standards (median 14 h fasting), many patients retained nontrivial quantities of gastric contents at surgery. Weighted NPO units did not exhibit statistically-significant relationships with either suctioned volume or US grade. However, suctioned volume did correspond well to US grade. NPO status may be a less reliable predictor of gastric contents at anesthesia induction in this patient population than has been assumed. Bedside US screening appears to provide more useful information for the planning of airway management.",

      "abstract": "The physiology of diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of perioperative aspiration, but there is limited and contradictory evidence on the incidence of \"full stomach\" in fasting diabetic patients. The aim of this study is to assess the baseline gastric content (using gastric ultrasound) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients scheduled for elective surgery who have followed standard preoperative fasting instructions. This was a prospective, noninferiority study of 180 patients (84 diabetic and 96 nondiabetic patients). Bedside ultrasound was used for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the gastric antrum in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions. Fasting gastric volume was estimated based on the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum and a validated model. The hypothesis was that diabetic patients would not have a higher baseline fasting gastric volume compared to nondiabetic patients, with a noninferiority margin of 0.4 ml/kg. Secondary aims included the comparison of the incidence of full stomach (solid content or more than 1.5 mL/kg of clear fluid), estimation of the 95th percentile of the gastric volume distribution in both groups, and examination of the association between gastric volume, glycemic control, and diabetic comorbidities. The baseline gastric volume was not higher in diabetic patients (0.81 ± 0.61 ml/kg) compared to nondiabetic patients (0.87 ± 0.53 ml/kg) with a mean difference of -0.07 ml/kg (95% CI, -0.24 to 0.10 ml/kg).

To assess the gastric volume, a reliable diagnostic tool is needed to prevent the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia, which remains a serious complication associated with anesthesia. Gastric antral ultrasound can provide reliable information about the size of the gastric antrum in traumatized patients undergoing emergency surgery. A prospective observational study of 45 polytrauma patients undergoing emergency surgery under general anesthesia was carried out. Prior to induction of anesthesia in the emergency department, gastric ultrasound was performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the gastric antrum in a supine position and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position. This was followed by routine placement of the nasogastric tube to aspirate and calculate the volume of the stomach contents. Of the 45 polytrauma patients, the risk assessment of aspiration and the anesthesia technique changed in 14 patients (31.1%) after the gastric ultrasound examination. A very good relationship existed between the expected stomach volume at the RLD position and the suction volume in the nasogastric tube. In all cases, no aspirations were documented. Ultrasound examination of the stomach in polytrauma patients allows assessing the size and type of stomach contents. The data obtained can influence the choice of anesthesia technique and reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

It focused on seven medically complex patient groups: those who are pregnant, obese, diabetic, have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are receiving emergency care, are enterally fed, or are taking GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Practice recommendations were developed using an iterative expert consensus process, with final recommendations based on evidence strength, clinical relevance, and expert agreement. Findings support the use of gastric POCUS in patients in active labor, those undergoing urgent cesarean sections, and those with diabetes. Conditional support is given for obesity, emergency care, enteral feeding, and GLP-1RA use. Routine use is not recommended in non-laboring pregnancies, elective cesarean delivery, or GERD. While gastric POCUS may aid with aspiration risk evaluation, its use should complement clinical judgment. Implementation may be limited by practical and training constraints, requiring individualized decision-making. These recommendations serve as a foundation for future research and potential clinical guideline development. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023445927.",
