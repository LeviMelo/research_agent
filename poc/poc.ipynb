    "# %% [single-cell PoC] PubMed → Qwen3 embeddings (title+abstract, no cap) → length-bucketed encoding\n",
    "# → HDBSCAN (no UMAP) → TF-IDF topics → LM Studio LLM labels → TF-IDF k-means comparison\n",
    "#\n",
    "# What this does:\n",
    "# 1) Pull ~1000 most recent PubMed records (last ~3y) for a query (default below).\n",
    "# 2) Build \"passage: {title}\\n\\n{abstract}\" strings (title+abstract is the default).\n",
    "# 3) Embed with Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B on CUDA, FP16, NO token cap.\n",
    "#    Uses LENGTH BUCKETING (short docs in big batches, long docs in small batches) + OOM backoff.\n",
    "# 4) Cluster directly in 1024-D with HDBSCAN (metric='euclidean' on L2-normalized vectors → ≈ cosine).\n",
    "# 5) For each cluster: compute TF-IDF top n-grams, pick central docs; ask LM Studio (gemma-3n-e2b-it)\n",
    "#    to propose a concise label from those hints.\n",
    "# 6) Build a TF-IDF+k-means lexical clustering and compare to HDBSCAN with ARI/AMI (diagnostic).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Notes:\n",
    "# - No UMAP anywhere (you asked to keep 1024-D embeddings).\n",
    "# - No token cap; we only bucket by length to keep batches stable on a 6–8 GB GPU.\n",
    "# - EFetch is CHUNKED to avoid 414 (URI too long).\n",
    "# - If flash-attn is installed, you can toggle it in model_kwargs. We default to safe settings.\n",
